Because this damage is caused by treatments and not the disease, it can affect patients with any type of cancer.\n\nAbout 1 in 4 of those young cancer patients will have Medicaid coverage as their insurance, said Dr. Lewis.\n\nIn his practice alone, Dr. Lewis says 1 of every 7 of his patients on average are of childbearing age and cost is often cited as the most significant barrier to fertility preservation.\n\nCosts can range from several hundred dollars for sperm banking to approximately $15,000 for egg banking.\n\nThese costs are often exacerbated by the short window of opportunity that cancer patients have before starting potentially sterilizing cancer treatment. While the costs faced by individual patients are high, the cost of implementing coverage across a population of insureds is very low.\n\nWhile adjusting to receiving a cancer diagnosis, Dr. Lewis says patients often have to think of preserving their fertility with additional procedures that often are not covered by their insurance plans as well as planning for their cancer treatments.\n\n\u201cThese patients face timely decisions about their cancer treatment as well as fertility preservation,\u201d said Dr. Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s just an awful agonizing whirlwind these patients go through.\u201d\n\nSome patients often have to turn to family, friends and even fundraising to find the funds to pay for fertility preservation, said Dr. Lewis.\n\nAccording to Dr. Lewis, the costs associated with preserving eggs and sperm, leads some patients to forego the fertility treatments or instead choose to dangerously delay cancer treatments, or even choose a treatment that might be less risky to their fertility \u2013 and those treatments may not be as effective.\n\n\u201cLoss of fertility is not merely a medical complication,\u201d said Dr. Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s a fundamental life function worthy of the highest levels of protection.\u201d\n\n", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.5769112710828294], [2, 0.08635293876324361], [3, 0.14173891481210457], [8, 0.15541725225318742], [12, 0.12950322502789294], [13, 0.15541725225318742], [14, 0.15541725225318742], [17, 0.7418840765955386]]}, {"author": ["Erin Cox"], "title": "Over 1,000 students attend Prom at Riverton High School", "date": "2021/03/25", "source": "https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/over-1-000-students-attend-prom-at-riverton-high-school", "article_body": "RIVERTON, Utah \u2014 More than a thousand students showed up to a high school prom this past weekend, a dance approved by the Jordan School District.\n\nThe Riverton High School gym was filled with 1,200 dancers \u2014 one of the largest dances students said they\u2019ve seen at their high school.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d walk in and there was just this biggest crowd,\u201d said Dylan Elliot, the Junior Class Vice President. \u201cWhen you stepped into that the environment and just the sheer amount of people was something really cool to see.\u201d\n\nRead: All Utahns 16+ now eligible to receive COVID-19 vaccine\n\nElliot helped plan the the dance with his colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe were able to do this safely,\u201d said Elliot.\n\nEvery single student had to be tested for COVID19 before showing up.\n\nCarolyn Gough, principal at Riverton High School, said they brought in about 25 volunteers from their district to help give the rapid COVID19 tests for those wanting to attend prom.\n\n\u201cWe had a systematic process of stamping a pass and making sure they bought that pass,\u201d said Gough. \u201cIt was numbered according to their name and according to their results.\u201d\n\nRead: Utah's governor signs COVID-19 'endgame' bill lifting statewide mask mandate April 10\n\nOnly three students tested positive and Gough said they were not from Riverton.\n\n\u201cWe still had to make contact with them,\u201d said Gough. \u201cWe still had to work with their families to help them understand what happens next, but we refunded any tickets purchased.\u201d\n\nOnce at the dance, students were required to wear masks.

Paul Ray, R-Clearfield, called the bill an \"endgame\" to get rid of restrictions and the ongoing pandemic emergency.\n\n\"I\u2019m excited that we now have an endgame as the pandemic winds down. The combination of vaccinations and recovered cases have brought our numbers down and it\u2019s time to start moving forward,\" Rep. Ray said in a text message to FOX 13. \"Utah has weathered this crisis better than nearly every other state and now with the restraints off, we can fully get back to business. I support an individuals choice to wear a mask and remind everyone to please be patient and kind to employees who work in businesses that still require a mask.\"\n\nOverall, the bill lifts health restrictions by July 1 or sooner if metrics are met, including a drop in virus cases and an increase in vaccinations. But its most controversial provision was the April 10 deadline to lift the mask mandate.\n\n\"This is not what we wanted. I\u2019ve been critical from the beginning,\" Gov. Cox told reporters at his monthly news conference last week.\n\nBut the governor said some in the legislature wanted to lift the mask mandate immediately, so he negotiated the terms of the bill with them. It was rewritten several times during the legislative session before it passed on the final night.\n\n\"This is the practical piece that I think a lot of people don\u2019t understand of the sausage-making,\" the governor said last week. \"We have a choice every time. We can say, 'Hey, we can veto a bill and we're not going to negotiate.' But when I involve myself in the negotiations, then I have do what I believe is best for the state and I have to get as much as I can. We believed they had the votes to override a veto for an immediate end to masks. I believe that wholeheartedly.\"\n\nMasks will still be required in schools and in gatherings larger than 50 people. The bill does allow local governments to seek their own mask mandates. Salt Lake County Council Chair Steve DeBry told FOX 13 that he intended to hold a special meeting on April 9 to see if that was necessary. It also does not prohibit businesses from requiring masks of customers and employees.\n\nOn Wednesday, the governor signed some other bills related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including one that reins in his own powers. Senate Bill 195 allows a governor to issue an emergency declaration, but it will be reviewed by the legislature after 30 days. The exception being for natural disasters.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Evan Vickers, R-Cedar City, who sponsored the bill, has said existing emergency powers law did not envision a pandemic.\n\nThe governor also signed a bill aimed at returning students to the classroom in the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill was originally created to force the Salt Lake City School District to return to in-person instruction. After a lot of negotiating, it was rewritten to increase COVID testing in all schools across the state and measures for closures related to outbreaks.\n\nThe governor vetoed a bill related to local health orders and schools because it was not part of the negotiations he had with the legislature.

He negotiated the April 10 date to end the statewide mask mandate with members of the Utah State Legislature, some of whom wanted to lift it immediately. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Paul Ray, R-Clearfield, lifts other health restrictions as vaccination rates rise and cases decline. But it allows local legislative bodies to seek their own mask mandates. Private businesses are also allowed to implement their own mask requirements for customers and employees.\n\nCouncil Chair DeBry said it remains to be seen if Utah's most populous county would remain under a mask mandate. Salt Lake County was among the first to adopt one last year, well ahead of then-Governor Gary Herbert implementing a statewide mandate in November.\n\n\"We don\u2019t want to see people die,\" DeBry told FOX 13. \"And we need to protect vulnerable people.\"\n\nHe also worried about variants, a resurgence of the virus and how long the COVID-19 vaccine would last before people need a booster shot. DeBry has been prodding the county to start preparing for changes now \u2014 to avoid a return to drastic health restrictions.\n\n\"We\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel, but my concern is long term. It\u2019s still going to be out there somewhere,\" he said of the virus. \"What do we have to do to stay on top of it so we don\u2019t go back into this vortex of last year?\"\n\nThe Salt Lake County Health Department urged Utahns to not wait to get their shot. Health department director Gary Edwards said the mass vaccine clinics the county has set up have handled around 30,000 people a week.\n\n\"We are prepared to do more than that, even double that,\" he said, adding it was based on dosage availability that comes through the federal government.\n\nEdwards urged people to sign up for appointments. As of Wednesday, the Salt Lake County Health Department had about 17,000 open slots through the end of April. He also pleaded with people not to go \"vaccine shopping,\" where they book an appointment and then look for another one that's more convenient or try to get a certain brand of vaccine. In some cases, as many as 600 appointments have been double-booked, leaving others locked out.\n\n\"That\u2019s 600 individuals that could have been vaccinated but weren\u2019t able to.

Obama turned to Biden early in his first term to lead the White House effort to draw down U.S. troops in the intractable war in Iraq.\n\nWith the move, Biden hopes to show he\u2019s taking the situation seriously after facing stiff criticism from Republicans as the flow of migrants has increased since he took office in January.\n\nWhile speaking, Biden put some of the blame for the border issues on the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cSo, this new surge we\u2019re dealing with now started with the last administration, but it\u2019s our responsibility to deal with it humanely and to stop what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Biden.\n\nHe said when he was vice president, he and Obama got a bipartisan agreement to provide over $700 million to the countries in the Northern Triangle of Central America, and determined the best way to keep people from coming to the U.S. was to keep them from wanting to leave their countries.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the last administration eliminated that funding, did not engage with it, did not use it, even though there was over $700 million to help get this done,\u201d said Biden. \u201cAnd we\u2019re re-instituting that program and there are many factors as to why people leave in the first place, but this is the source of one of the reasons why we\u2019ve had such a, before we took office, in the midst of the last administration, a somewhat draconian policy of separating children from their parents, etc.\u201d\n\nBiden said he can\u2019t think of anybody more qualified to head the effort than Harris, who ran the second largest attorney general\u2019s office in the country in California, dealing with human rights and organized crime.\n\n\u201cWhen she speaks, she speaks for me, doesn\u2019t have to check with me. She knows what she\u2019s doing, and I hope we can move this along,\u201d said Biden.\n\nAfter thanking the president for having confidence in her, Harris said there\u2019s no question that the work will be challenging.\n\n\"As the president has said, there are many factors that lead residents to leave these countries and while we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law and that we also, because we can chew gum and walk at the same time, must address the root causes that cause people to make the trek that the president has described to come here,\u201d said Harris.\n\nHarris said she also looks forward to working with Congress to address root causes of the migration issues.\n\n\u201cNeedless to say, the work will not be easy, but it is important work. It\u2019s work that we demand, and the people of our countries need to help stem the tide that we have seen,\u201d said Harris.\n\n", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.4300187629433148], [4, 0.2569225215352836], [5, 0.6954723992725869], [7, 0.1842831278971564], [16, 0.06723150603829202], [18, 0.07727471103028742], [19, 0.46364826618172456], [21, 0.07727471103028742]]}, {"author": ["Jeff Tavss"], "title": "Stage 1 Water Shortage Advisory declared for Salt Lake City", "date": "2021/03/24", "source": "https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/stage-1-water-shortage-advisory-declared-for-salt-lake-city", "article_body": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall declared a Stage 1 Water Shortage Advisory Wednesday.\n\nThe move was made as this year's anticipated flow of water from local creeks that help supply water is expected to be 43 to 61 percent of average.\n\nREAD: Utah prepares for water restrictions in drought emergency\n\nAccording to city officials, soil moisture is exceptionally low, which is contributing to the \"inefficient\" spring runoff.\n\nStage 1 of the city's Five-State Water Shortage Contingency Plan is voluntary, used to send a message to residents to do their part to avoid shortages and be mindful of water use.\n\n\u201cWe want to invite and encourage everyone in our City, as well as the other municipalities we serve, to look at ways to reduce their water use, increase their water use efficiency and eliminate any water waste,\u201d said Mayor Mendenhall. \u201cWe can prevent any serious shortages for the rest of the year through conservation by planning and preparing now, today.\u201d\n\nMendenhall asks residents and businesses to take the following actions to help conserve water:\n\nSign up for a free water check to help determine efficient watering levels for lawn and landscapes.\n\nto help determine efficient watering levels for lawn and landscapes.

It\u2019s not a Black person using it on me, it\u2019s a Black person saying it in a space where I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m one of the very few Black people in the room.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWhat do I do with that? Who do I tell? I just have so many questions about the other people who are taking this class \u2014 are they hearing the word? I just feel like, suddenly, J. Cole and Adrian and I are performing for whoever else is in this class, and I can\u2019t see them.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm. I mean, not to be all armchair psycho about it, but you know, it sounds like, in a way, Adrian feels like he can assert his Blackness in this predominantly white space. We can\u2019t ignore the fact that this is happening in the wake of everything that happened last year, and especially last summer.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMhm.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI think Black people in this country have been waiting for the opportunity to take up a lot more psychic space, and I think Black people in this country were like, I am tired of feeling like I can\u2019t talk about the treatment that I endure. We\u2019ve seen people dropping the veneer of whatever post-racial fantasy. No, I want to talk about my day-to-day lived experience, which excites me, actually.\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut you know, it sounds like Adrian is using whatever tools he has at hand to take up space.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. Adrian didn\u2019t say why he played this J. Cole song, why that song was on his playlist. But every time I hear the word, though, I\u2019m just thinking, like, god, this word, this word. Why this word? I don\u2019t want to be dealing with this right now. Why, why, why?\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou know, again, I cannot see who else is in the class, but what I\u2019m thinking as I\u2019m hearing this J. Cole song is like, is anybody else bothered by this? And if they are bothered by it, is it a Black person who is bothered by it in the same way that I am?\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, I am always in awe of its deployment by Black people, but then I get really annoyed, as well, because I never, ever, ever want to hear that word coming out of a white person\u2019s mouth, no matter what. And I also think that, among most Black people, that is settled. Like, we don\u2019t want to hear y\u2019all say it because it just feels so devastating. And I\u2019m of two minds about it. And I guess that sounds like a double standard, but it really isn\u2019t if you sit with it and think about it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, I think this is the exact right moment to talk about this word. And we should talk about the spectrum of usages, not just in my exercise class or in music, but every place this word has resurfaced.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd you know, look, this word is heavy. It brings up a lot, clearly, for both of us, and we assume for our listeners, as well. And so we don\u2019t want you to be like Wesley caught out in Adrian\u2019s class, so this is just a little bit of a heads-up that we will be employing the word in all its uses in this episode. And prepare the body, do some little squats, get some water, because we\u2019re going to do this. Let\u2019s see what happens. Wesley, I know you\u2019re down. I\u2019m down. So get the \u201cGreen Book,\u201d get your mask, get in the car, let\u2019s go.\n\n[theme music]\n\nI\u2019m Jenna Wortham.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThis is Still Processing.\n\nwesley morris\n\nJenna.\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh, Wesley.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou and I have for years been talking about the n-word. We\u2019ve been talking about our relationship to it. We\u2019ve been talking about whether we need it, how I feel about it, whether you use it. Part of the reason that I\u2019ve been thinking about this word so much is that it\u2019s been in our workplace recently.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the reason it\u2019s been in our work life is because a colleague used it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nA ton has been written about this incident, and if you really want to know more, Google is your friend. You can just deep dive right on in. But just to give you a quick overview of what happened, a white colleague of ours was on a school trip with a bunch of high school kids and used the word in a sentence. You know \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight. He used it quoting the word. He was not using it in the sort of conventional racist way. But he used it. And it essentially became this flashpoint in a conversation about whether or not it was OK to use the word. And you know, is there ever a good time to use it?\n\njenna wortham\n\nWell, and to get a little more specific, the debate spins out from there, ultimately results in our colleague leaving his job and leaving the New York Times.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd you know, I think that the thing that really upset me was that this word was going to threaten to tear our newsroom apart. You could feel it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nFor sure.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd it\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that this old-ass word is still boiling people\u2019s blood, it is still costing people things, it\u2019s still hurting people. I mean, I just can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat word, it\u2019s not something that you expect to deal with in your workplace. You just feel so exposed and so vulnerable. And like, it just turns you inside out, because you\u2019re kind of doing this mental inventory of dredging up all the times someone has said the word around you or to you, and then tried to tell you it wasn\u2019t a big deal or to get over yourself. Because that\u2019s what this word does, it lives beyond time. And it\u2019s not something that anyone should have to deal with when they just want to show up and do their job. And it ate up so much of my energy. I mean, I kept being like, I\u2019m fine, but then while this was happening, at the end of every workday, I was just completely depleted. I didn\u2019t even have enough energy to take a bath. And I finally had to just admit and to reconcile, like, this is taking a huge toll. There\u2019s this Toni Morrison quote that is just very grammable, and so I\u2019ve seen it a bunch, but I\u2019ll just paraphrase it. But it\u2019s essentially that the function of racism is to be a distraction. And you get so caught up in explaining yourself and explaining your reason for being \u2014 and essentially defending your existence \u2014 that everything else falls away. And Ms. Morrison is cautioning us, do not fall into the trap. She\u2019s right. I mean, it\u2019s the only thing that you and I were able to talk about. Like, we were spending more time on the phone digging into this incident than we were talking about our book projects, talking about this show, talking about our love lives, talking about what we were cooking for dinner. Like, all we were obsessed with and consumed with was this word. And it was so unfair.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. I think it\u2019s America\u2019s word. I think that white people have a stake in it as much as Black people do. And it\u2019s been very interesting to watch white people defend their ability to use it. And it just really strikes me as being about a kind of sense of ownership in a way that they might not even intend.\n\njenna wortham\n\nDeeply embedded in that ownership is the most incredible time capsule, or maybe it\u2019s a ticking time bomb. And I think it\u2019s scary because I\u2019m like, do you know what lineage you\u2019re invoking? Do you understand how that word has been wielded throughout time? And maybe you should revisit \u201cRoots\u201d and just reorient yourself in the power of this word and the way it really comes from a desire to limit and reduce and diminish and humiliate and really render a person into nothingness. And ask yourself, is that worth all this?\n\nwesley morris\n\nBut I mean, the fact of the matter is that you and I are talking about a thing that is, like, among Black people, settled, right? Like, I mean, it seems \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nYes.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 settled, like, because it\u2019s so baked into Black culture that it\u2019s not going anywhere. When I lived in San Francisco, when I was 23 and 24 and 25 years old, I get on Muni, and you know, there\u2019d be some Filipino kids or some Chicano kids just hanging out on the subway n-wording each other.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd I\u2019m like \u2014 I would go up to them as a recent college graduate and be like, yo \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh my god.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 y\u2019all need to stop. This is not your word. You can\u2019t say that.\n\njenna wortham\n\nProfessor Morris \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\n\u2014 reporting for duty. I love it so much.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. But I will report back to you that it didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThey were like, get out of my face.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. And I think part of what I was thinking, or what I was trying to do, was preserve it. If I could just get it out of Chicano usage, then I could sort of get Black people to stop using it, too. But it was a folly. Again, I was 23, and I realized it just wasn\u2019t useful. Like, there\u2019s no point in doing this. In terms of where it\u2019s going in the culture and who is using it, it\u2019s settled. It\u2019s settled. And to the degree to which, like, I was trying to win something, I was going to lose. I was just going to lose. I just had to come up with my own relationship to that word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYes. It almost sounds like you\u2019re trying to contain something that is uncontainable. You\u2019re trying to put this tool back in its box, right?\n\nwesley morris\n\nI was trying to put a lid on a boiling pot that had boiled all \u2014 been boiling over for centuries. Yes. Yes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nWhy did that feel important to you?\n\nwesley morris\n\nWow, Jenna. Because it\u2019s such an ugly word. It\u2019s such a, like, horrible word to me, and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 like, hearing it come out of mouths that weren\u2019t even Black people, but they weren\u2019t white people, either. And they weren\u2019t using it maliciously, right? But it didn\u2019t matter because to my ear, hearing it come out of any non-Black mouth, it upset me. It hurt me that they didn\u2019t understand the degree to which that word is a toxic or radioactive element in any Black person\u2019s social life. It was as common for them to call each other the n-word as it was for Black people to use it on each other.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, when people are using that word in that really familial, familiar sense who are not Black, right, it\u2019s of course the co-option of Black culture and the proximity to Blackness. You get so many points by inhabiting Blackness, but not actually being Black yourself, right? Just look at the entire Kardashian empire. And I\u2019m really thinking about this pink Uno deck that came out this summer from one of the Jenners. Like, Uno, why? Why? It makes me angry to think about it. Like, you know why, right? Because they wanted to name that they know about Black things, including Uno. Let it go, OK? There are hundreds of card games that you could have chosen, and you chose that one for a very particular reason. As a related note, the artist Nina Chanel Abney put a a Uno deck \u2014 a very Black Uno deck \u2014 which is amazing. I bought 10 of them, just in defiance to the Jenner deck. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is, the closer you can get to Blackness and Black people without actually being Black, it places you in this really interesting cultural hierarchy because people love that. They love it. They love to see Blackness on non-Black people. It feels really edgy. It feels really cool. It feels like you\u2019re getting close to something without actually having to engage with the thing itself, also called anti-Blackness. But so I think there\u2019s that. I guess, you know, I\u2019m always in awe of the n-word. And as much as I don\u2019t want to hear it, when it is employed in this cultural sense \u2014 whether it\u2019s used as a greeting, whether it\u2019s used in a song, pretty much any time it\u2019s not being used by a white person, right \u2014 I really have to take a step back and, like, admire the power and the energy that it took to transform that word into something that can be used in that way. That word, which was erected to create a category of otherness, to create a category of non-humanness, to create a category of people who weren\u2019t even seen as people, but to create us and then y\u2019all. And we can do whatever we want to y\u2019all because you\u2019re not really people, you\u2019re this other word. And to really, over time, that that word could mutate into this other usage, I mean, that is like \u2014 think about the power that that takes. Think about how much energy you have to invest. It took years of polishing that word, right, to get it to where it needed to be. To change it enough that it could be used in a way, in a multitude of ways, that are vastly different from the original creation of that word.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. Yeah, I think that a little bit of what I\u2019m trying to get at about the Muni situation was I think, in some ways, the fight for what it took to get to the place where Black people could even use it and have it be loving and affectionate and normalized, but at the same time, you know \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nYeah.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 I grew up in a family that didn\u2019t use it. And I think my grandmother, who was born in 1928, was one of those \u2014 we\u2019re basically Yankees. Nobody goes any further south than Maryland on my mother\u2019s side of the family. And \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nI love that.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 most of us are in Philadelphia. My family was really concerned with, as were many people in my grandmother\u2019s generation, with being upstanding and good even if you were poor and had nothing \u2014 which we were, and had lots of nothing. But there was this dichotomy that springs up, which is the difference between a Negro and an n-word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh, lord. Yes, many conversations were had about that when I was a child.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou know, my grandmother had a whole speech about n-words versus Black people. So much of their self-worth was in being defined against the n-word, and a lifetime \u2014 a childhood, childhoods, of being called that word by white people. And I mean, I don\u2019t know if you remember this, but Chris Rock has a very, very, very famous routine about this. In his classic \u201cBring the Pain\u201d routine, that I VHSed, by the way \u2014 I used to watch that over and over and over and over \u2014 he starts and says, I love Black people, but I hate n-words.\n\narchived recording (chris rock) Now, we\u2019ve got a lot of things, a lot of racism going on in the world right now. Who is more racist, Black people or white people? Black people. You know why? Because we hate Black people, too. Everything white people don\u2019t like about Black people, Black people really don\u2019t like about Black people.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the audience goes crazy because they know that he\u2019s about to go there.\n\narchived recording (chris rock) There\u2019s like a civil war going on with Black people. And there\u2019s two sides. There\u2019s Black people and there\u2019s [n-words]. And [n-words] have got to go. Every time Black people want to have a good time, ignorant-ass [n-words] [EXPLCIT] it up.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHe\u2019s using the word, and he is letting it sit in his mouth like a really delicious sip of red wine that is still oxidizing. Like, he\u2019s holding it in his mouth, just getting all the flavor out of it. Like, he\u2019s chewing it like a piece of meat.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean, he\u2019s also making it sound like the word that it is, right? He\u2019s making it sound like it is a vile, ugly, disgusting word. The disgust with which he says that word, every time he says it, it is palpable, and it is vicious and vivid.\n\narchived recording (chris rock) Can\u2019t go to a movie the first week it come out. Why? Because [n-words] are shooting at the screen. Hey, I love Black people, but I hate [n-words].\n\njenna wortham\n\nYeah, that bit is really working on so many levels. And there\u2019s of course just like the entry level, right, which is it\u2019s been a lecture that\u2019s been passed down to you from your parents, your grandparents. But it\u2019s also acknowledging the vestigial hatred and trauma that comes with the need \u2014 I\u2019m using air quotes \u2014 to make that distinction, right? And this kind of historical, repetitive task that Black people find themselves engaged in \u2014 that I still find myself engaged in \u2014 when you start doing kind of these mental gymnastics to physically, emotionally, psychically assert that you\u2019re not a bad Black person. You\u2019re not one of them, right? And it\u2019s something that comes up for me when I go into like a high-end store. I try to look like I have money. You know, it\u2019s something that comes up for me when I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019ve actually stopped doing this, to be honest with you, but like making sure my hands are out of my pockets or making sure that my purse isn\u2019t open. I mean, I don\u2019t carry purses \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh, I still \u2014 involuntary things I do when I go into public space so that nobody gets the wrong idea about me, same thing.\n\njenna wortham\n\nRight.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThere\u2019s a degree to which being Black is a lot about optics, and a lot about having white people, having white society \u2014 the American caste system, basically \u2014 take you seriously to seem or look or sound worthy of being in that upper tier of the caste system, right? Part of my visceral reaction as being a 23-year-old who had finally felt like he had made it in San Francisco was the hope and prayer that I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with that word. And the idea that I\u2019m just on a subway on the West Coast \u2014 a place I had never been before but had these utopian feelings about \u2014 and here I am on the subway, as though I had never even left Philadelphia, having to contend with this word being used by not even Black people or white people? It just was too much for me. And I think that, to the degree to which my personality has been formed without even realizing it, Jenna, in opposition to being an n-word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd it\u2019s tied to that bit because it comes from a place of having to fight for your worthiness, and it also comes from a direct historical experience of people who were called that word and their life hung in the balance, right? Like, someone is saying that word to you, you know that they\u2019re also willing to probably kill you, right? And so that\u2019s something your grandmother\u2019s tapping into, that\u2019s something my father is tapping into when they\u2019re telling us don\u2019t be an n-word. And it\u2019s really scary and it\u2019s really sad. And I think, you know, you and I are both reading the same book right now, which is by Randall Kennedy. It\u2019s called \u2014 the first word \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe actual word.\n\njenna wortham\n\n\u2014 it\u2019s called the actual word, colon, \u201cThe Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.\u201d And career is so interesting as a term because it is doing work. It is performing labor. And that labor is divisive. The labor is, as long as there\u2019s someone below me, I\u2019m OK. And again, that\u2019s like a very insidious example of, like, white supremacist thinking that continues to need a lowest common denominator to rise above. And so for me, that\u2019s the most interesting case to retire the word, even among Black people, because it does work. Like, it does a type of work that even when we can\u2019t directly see it sweating, it is working, honey. Like, it is working in the same way that it worked since it came into existence.\n\nwesley morris\n\nIt\u2019s also much different to say it than it is to write it, I have to say. To put it in a set of quotation marks in a piece that you are writing no matter who you are is just different to me than saying it out loud. I have to make a reservation with my soul a week in advance before I say the word. It\u2019s like, Wesley, don\u2019t forget, on March 15, 2021, you are going to say the whole word. This is the gymnastics that I put myself through, where like even the idea of saying it just results in me, like, almost having a stroke. You know, I\u2019ve been on this journey with this word, just really thinking about it in ways that I had never really seriously thought about it before, because I was so busy reacting against it. But I actually think that there is something \u2014 for as ugly as it is, I also think there\u2019s something so beautiful about it. And I think that, when you feel its power and you feel \u2014 when you see a Black person wield it, there\u2019s also just nothing, nothing like that. So let\u2019s just take a break. And when we come back, we\u2019re just going to talk about the beauty of the word. The impossible beauty of that word.\n\n[music]\n\njenna wortham\n\nI have to admit that I always feel a little silly saying, like, the n-word, as though that doesn\u2019t mean something else.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThe n-word, you know? Like, what does that even mean, you know?\n\nwesley morris\n\nJenna, you\u2019re reading my mind. Yeah.\n\njenna wortham\n\nIt\u2019s so like, OK, we\u2019re children. But listen, I grew up in a household where that word was not permitted to be used in any capacity. It was pretty well-ingrained in me, that\u2019s not a word we use. And because I\u2019m me, and pretty much everything someone tells me I can\u2019t do, I find a way to do \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh my god, this is where we\u2019re the opposite.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI\u2019m a boundary pusher. I love finding the limits of something and then trying to get past that. So when I got to college, I went to U.V.A., as you know, which is a predominantly white school, but jokingly inside we called it a knockoff H.B.C.U. because there were just so many Black people there. And I met this crew of girls. We became super tight. We\u2019re still close. And we loved to call each other the n-word. It felt really good to live in this space. It felt really good to be defiant. It felt really good to feel out something, at least for me, that had been taboo, and to play around with it and just employ it very liberally. And it felt like ours. It felt like something that belonged to us and only we could use, and we really leaned into it. And I felt really free. You know? It felt really fun. And it also felt like kinship. You know? It felt really special to have this term of endearment that always cracked us up. And I feel like we played around a lot with figuring out how to say it, because that one word with the A-A-H at the end of it has eons of inflections to it. It just contains entire galaxies of humor if you say it at the right time, in the right tone of voice, cutting it off at the exact right minute. I mean, in itself is such a tool of comedy. And it was fun to figure out how to perfect and play around with it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMhm.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut I\u2019ve gone through over the last couple of years and really worked through really working on removing gender-specific references, gendered pronouns, skimming my vocabulary and my assumptions about ableism. You know, making space for different experiences and really trying to be mindful. So I\u2019ve just arrived in a place, where I\u2019m at today, it just doesn\u2019t feel as good. And I think I\u2019m just really tuning in to a sensitivity and a frequency of, you know, we\u2019re tired. And a lot of us \u2014 and I\u2019m speaking right now about Black people \u2014 a lot of us are just really fragile. At some point in the last nine years, after Trayvon Martin, I mean, I was experiencing this myself, but I just became really attuned to a fragility among some Black people. And understanding how the word, even when used by Black people in \u2014 I\u2019ll just say a safe space, in community spaces \u2014 that it still dredged up that historical trauma, and that it still had this impact really shaped me. And it just naturally faded away. Like, it faded from my popular use. And it felt right. You know? That felt right. I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody. I don\u2019t want to inflict more harm upon a Black person if I can help it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, I mean, you know, this is a word that has been \u2014 any living Black person, it\u2019s been in your life probably the entire time you\u2019ve been living.\n\njenna wortham\n\nIt\u2019s probably been in your life even before you knew what the word meant.\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh, yeah.\n\njenna wortham\n\nLike, I remember my niece coming home from school and being like, what\u2019s jigger? Like, in preschool. It starts even before you have a sense of yourself as a racialized being. The world racializes you first. This is why we get so worked up about it, because it is just so much bigger than one instance, one mistake, one rap lyric. You know? It really enters your life even before you get a chance to figure out how you want to live your life. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is, when I was younger, I felt like that word was the only thing that, without a doubt, belonged to me as a Black person that did not belong to a white person. And if you really think about it, that\u2019s sad. But that\u2019s not my inheritance. That\u2019s not the thing that goes into the dowry, right? That\u2019s not in my trunk of keepsakes that I\u2019ll take with me when I move into my married house like in the old days. You know? It\u2019s just not an antique for me. You know? It wasn\u2019t mine to begin with. I\u2019m in awe of it, but it\u2019s not in my shoebox.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMm. You know, I was thinking about how aware of it I was as a kid. You know, my dad was a big comedy records person. He listened to all his favorite comedians. And one of his favorite people to listen to, Richard Pryor.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHm. Mhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd Richard Pryor is the greatest practitioner of the n-word in the history of its usage.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nNobody has done more to simultaneously problematize that word, but also to normalize it as a way of being in the world.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, it\u2019s so funny because you sent me the album, and I didn\u2019t listen to it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI sent you a copy of \u201cThat N-word Is Crazy.\u201d\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm. So when I think of Richard Pryor, I think about my dad. I think about Joe Wortham because he loved that type of comedy. Even though we were not allowed to use the n-word, even though we were not \u2014 oh my god, we had so many rules, and I think this is very much from my dad\u2019s trauma of growing up in the South, and then even being in Philadelphia, you know, I think he had a lot of trauma around us getting fingered as n-words with the hard \u201d-er.\u201d So there were a lot of rules about what we could and couldn\u2019t say, how we were supposed to speak, how we were supposed to wear our hair. When I was younger, it felt so controlling and restrictive \u2014 and it was. And I also, now that I\u2019ve aged, I understand that he was trying to protect us from something that he had not been able to protect himself from. And he wasn\u2019t able to protect us from it, either, to be honest, but that really weighs on my mind. So it was this confusing thing for me. So I would be a little kid. You know, picture me eight, nine, 10 years old on my belly, coloring in a book. And Richard Pryor is on the TV, you know, saying this word. And I\u2019m just like (GASPING) in that little kid way, where you\u2019re like, that\u2019s a bad word. So for me, Richard Pryor just always had this association of taboo. And even as an adult, I still haven\u2019t fully listened to that record. And you sent it to me. You sent me a copy, and I couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t do it. I felt scared to open that chest.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMhm. That\u2019s fascinating. Yeah, I mean, he is doing the work of reclaiming the word, in a way. I mean, you know, at that point, it is long part of African-American vernacular, but there\u2019s something about the way that he\u2019s doing it where, like, none of the other Black comedians were using that word. Dick Gregory didn\u2019t use it. Moms Mabley didn\u2019t use it. Flip Wilson didn\u2019t use it. Bill Cosby didn\u2019t use it. It was Richard Pryor.\n\narchived recording (richard pryor) White folks do things a lot different than [n-words] do. They eat quiet and shit you build out of it. archived recording 1 Pass the potatoes. [LAUGHTER] archived recording 2 Thank you, darling. Could I have a bit of that sauce?\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the thing that really moved me was the way that it just wants that word to be another word for person \u2014 for Black person \u2014 and to unload it of all its negative connotations. It\u2019s so far away from Chris Rock\u2019s usage. There aren\u2019t Black people and n-words. There are just n-words. Every Black person is an n-word.\n\narchived recording (richard pryor) A lot of [n-words] ain\u2019t scared, you know what I mean? Like when the Martians landed and shit, white folks got scared. Oh, my. Golly! I\u2019ll tell ya! Just a big ol\u2019 helicopter thing came down and landed. People got on [INAUDIBLE] all over their body! Big ol\u2019 claw hands and shit! Jesus Christ! Nothing can scare a [n-word] after 400 years of this shit.\n\nwesley morris\n\nIt\u2019s still the most shocking word in the English language. It now just exists in two polar states. On the one hand, with Richard Pryor, there are white people. And on the other hand, there are n-words.\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] Well, there are polls, and then there are hand grenades, like the one Rihanna threw on February 1 in response to a tweet hosted by Daniel Cameron.\n\nwesley morris\n\nDaniel Cameron, of course, being the attorney general of Kentucky, the man who presented the case to the grand jury as to whether or not to indict the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor\u2019s death.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd in case you didn\u2019t feel the giant wave of grief and sadness in September that rocked many people\u2019s worlds, none of them were indicted for her death. That decision unleashed such a wave of depression and disgust and anger and angst that, once again, another unarmed Black person dies at the hand of the police and no one is willing to do anything. So there\u2019s just a lot around this man who was Black. So five months later, this man dust off his microphone and tweets, \u201cToday marks the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth.\u201d And then Twitter auto-populates with the little trifecta of the three Black raised fist. Then it continues. \u201cThis month, let\u2019s take time to remember and celebrate the contributions Black men and women have made to our Commonwealth and our nation.\u201d So he tweets that. And here comes Rihanna. She retreats him and adds the line, \u201cSup, n-word. #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor.\u201d Microphone drop.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah, well, we should talk about what she\u2019s making that word do.\n\njenna wortham\n\nWell, it\u2019s very interesting to notice that she employed the heated spayd games version with the \u201ca\u201d and not the historic plantation version with the \u201cer.\u201d That\u2019s the first thing to notice.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe other thing is that \u2014 this is a Black on Black operation here. It\u2019s happening on Twitter in a very public place. But it also is like an interesting call in, because it\u2019s simultaneously about this Black person not doing right by Black people \u2014 according to, in this instance, Rihanna and the many people who agree with her that justice was not served for Breonna Taylor. But it also \u2014 she\u2019s using the word in the ugliest possible way that you can use it on a Black person, which is to say that you are an instrument of white power.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou\u2019re perpetuating harm against Black people. And you aren\u2019t doing all that you can to live up to the best of what Black History Month purports to be about. And she is saying that whatever you just tweeted is hypocrisy. And all of those things are there in that one word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd she\u2019s also letting him know, like \u2014 I mean, this is the part that\u2019s hard to really grapple with, but he can always just be an n-word.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThat\u2019s the other usage, right? That\u2019s the other thing that this tweet is connected to for me. And so you have these two contexts for this word converging in these two words. And it\u2019s just \u2014 I hope nobody ever sends me a tweet like that.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI was just thinking that. But I also think that her ability to use it \u2014 it is such a linguistic power move. Especially an artist, right? Someone who\u2019s thinking with so much deliberation about lyrics and words and presentation. Like, of course Rihanna understands, with just so much clarity and awareness, the chimeric quality of language and especially that word.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, I mean, you saying that makes me want to ask you if we can go back to Adrian Williams for a second.\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] OK.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWhy is what she did to Daniel Cameron OK to my visceral self? And I have a real problem being in that space with Adrian Williams and these white people that I can\u2019t see with the J. Cole song. And the place that it takes me is this song by Solange, and I know very well, called \u201cFUBU.\u201d Writ large, the song is basically about Black culture belonging to Black people. And the opening lyrics of the song are all my n-words in the whole wide world.\n\n[music - solange, \"fubu\"]\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) All my [n-words] in the whole wide world.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd it\u2019s just so clear that she\u2019s drawing a line around a kind of space, around a kind of cultural space.\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) Make this song to make it all y\u2019all\u2019s turn for us. This shit is for us.\n\njenna wortham\n\nWell, as improbable as it sounds, I\u2019m not sure that the deployment is all that different between Adrian and Solange, truth be told. You know, Solange makes this album in 2017. And the name of the album is \u201cA Seat at the Table.\u201d And she does an interview and she\u2019s describing her word choice in that song. And she acknowledges, I don\u2019t normally use the n-word in my songs. But at the time, I was on a road trip through Marfa, of all places. Marfa, Texas \u2014 really gorgeous artsy town in West Texas. Sky for days. A lot of creatives go there to make work. A lot of Black artists go there to make work. Solange is like, we\u2019re visiting friends. We\u2019ve been here a million times. And we have this really scary encounter with the police, right? They get hassled. And she\u2019s also reading \u201cCitizen: An American Lyric\u201d by Claudia Rankine who\u2019s a poet and devotes an entire text to her relationship to racism and racial aggressions and microaggressions and the depressed state it leaves her in. And Solange is just like, you know what? I\u2019m not going to tiptoe around it. I\u2019m going to say what I want. I\u2019m going to lean into my artistic intuition, which is telling me to make a song, and to make this song. And there are just some things that are for us. And you know, in that song, she\u2019s not just talking about the n-word. She\u2019s talking about cornrows, she\u2019s talking about affectations of speech. She\u2019s just talking about so many things. You can put these things on all you want. You can layer on all these accouterments of blackness. But you will never be Black. Some things are for us.\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) All my [n-words] in the whole wide world.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHearing her do that song live really does something in the body. It does something to you. It does create a space. And even if you\u2019re in mixed company, even if there are non-Black people there, it still gives you that endorphin high that you always get in a musical setting when you\u2019re in a live music setting. But you really feel loved and cared for and a sense of ownership. And it\u2019s also like a caution, it\u2019s like a yellow yield sign too where she\u2019s also saying, back up, because if you are a white person in that space, and you\u2019re watching people really just have a full body transformative experience, I think you understand something too, right? And it became this anthem of pride and ownership. And then when her next album comes out, \u201cWhen I Get Home,\u201d she releases a song called \u201cAlmeda\u201d which has the same message, the same energy, and does not use the n-word.\n\n[music - solange, \"almeda\"]\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) We just sittin\u2019 here fooling around. We just sittin\u2019 here coolin\u2019 around. We just sittin\u2019 here high, comin\u2019 down.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd she\u2019s just going through all these things she loves about being Black. And it has the exact same effect in some ways. It\u2019s just a different approach into it. I mean, just like, what kind of white person is going to sing along to all the n-words in \u201cFUBU\u201c? I mean, it\u2019s also really hard, I think, to be a white person or a non-Black person and sing along to the lyrics in \u201cAlmeda\u201d which \u2014 brown skin, brown face, brown leather, brown sugar, brown \u2014 I mean, you know \u2014 black waves, black days, black baes, black things.\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) \u2014 brown zippers, brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves, black days, black baes, black days.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThese are Black-owned things. That\u2019s also precious. And that\u2019s also something that is creating this protective sphere around everyone that\u2019s listening to it and singing along to it. You know, I think it was really important for her as an artist to say, I\u2019m fed up. And this is what that looks like. And then to kind of keep that thread going and do it in a totally different way because \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, I think, Adrian, his own way \u2014 he was fed up. And he was tired of feeling like he had to tiptoe around something.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah, yeah. I mean he \u2014 it\u2019s interesting though, because it\u2019s so subtle, right? You know, that reclamation of space, because it doesn\u2019t make it any easier to hear that word in that space, because I guess I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m sharing that space with. And I think that does matter still to me. And he and I might even disagree about whether it\u2019s even worth playing that song. But I definitely respect his right to do it. I feel like that for me is a journey that I\u2019ve been on since I\u2019ve been talking to you. [LAUGHTER]\n\njenna wortham\n\nWe\u2019re definitely on it together. We\u2019re on it together.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThere\u2019s a story that you and I have with this word. And the reason \u2014 I want to tell you something about how it made me feel when you used it on me.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAre you really going to talk about that?\n\nwesley morris\n\nI do. I want to talk about it. Jenna, come on.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAll right, fine.\n\nwesley morris\n\nCome with me on this. Do you remember how you used it on me?\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] Yes, because it was purely without thinking. We were working together. You had done something ridiculous. And it just slipped. I was like, listen, like what are \u2014 no, what are you doing? And you were like \u2014 your face dropped. And I immediately apologized. I was like, I\u2019m so sorry. I realized we are different, of different ilks. I am so sorry. I did. I felt really bad. I still feel really bad.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI remember absorbing it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou did your Wesley thing when you\u2019re uncomfortable, which is you just busted out into a very inexplicable long laugh that had no end for many seconds. You just kept laughing.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, for the next three or four days after that, I was like, Jenna called me the n-word. Jenna called me the n-word. But it made me feel loved, I have to say.\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] This is crazy! This is bananas.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s really crazy. [LAUGHS] It\u2019s true, though.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThis word is bananas.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe word is bananas. But I only received it as \u2014 I mean, I was shocked that you said it. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. And I was like, I don\u2019t know. When Black people, in the rare occasions when it happens to me, when a person feels like they can do it, [SIGHS] I do feel like it\u2019s the Richard Pryor usage. It\u2019s love. And I carry that around with me, too.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut that\u2019s \u2014 I am wondering why, that if you\u2019ve experienced that were as a vector of love and affection, what stops you from using it in the same way?\n\nwesley morris\n\n[SIGHS] [LAUGHS]\n\njenna wortham\n\nThere is that uncomfortable laughter again. I love it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe truth, the honest to God truth \u2014 the first thing that comes to my mind as an answer is I\u2019m just not that kind of Black person. I didn\u2019t grow up using it. And I get a lot of pleasure from other people\u2019s use of it so that I don\u2019t have to use it. You know, I mean \u2014 I mean, for me, it would require becoming a kind of different person in my imagining of what it would be like to use that word. I mean, maybe there\u2019ll be some point at which I\u2019m comfortable partaking in that. But I don\u2019t feel I have that in me. Does that make sense?\n\njenna wortham\n\nDefinitely.\n\n[theme music]\n\nwesley morris\n\nThat\u2019s our show. And the good news is that we\u2019re sticking around for a whole season.

Jan. \u201921 While vaccination efforts have gathered speed and restrictions on activities have receded in many states, the job market is showing signs of life. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week to 657,000, a decrease of 100,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the lowest weekly level of initial state claims since the pandemic upended the economy a year ago. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims totaled 684,000. In addition, there were 242,000 new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program covering freelancers, part-timers and others who do not routinely qualify for state benefits, a decrease of 43,000. Unemployment claims have been at historically high levels for the past year, partly because some workers have been laid off more than once. Much of the drop last week was accounted for by a decline in new claims in Ohio and Illinois, but economists said the overall trend was encouraging. \u201cThis is definitely a positive signal and a move in the right direction,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. \u201cWe would expect to see further improvements as vaccines roll out and restrictions are lifted.\u201d Between the state and federal programs, the total number of new jobless claims was just under 900,000 after being stuck above one million a week. Although the pace of vaccinations, as well as passage of a $1.9 trillion relief package this month, has lifted economists\u2019 expectations for growth, the labor market has lagged behind other measures of recovery. Still, the easing of restrictions on indoor dining areas, health clubs, movie theaters and other gathering places offers hope for the millions of workers who were let go in the last 12 months. And the $1,400 checks going to most Americans as part of the relief bill should help spending perk up in the weeks ahead. Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said she hoped for consistent employment gains but her optimism was tempered by concern about the longer-term displacement of workers by the pandemic. \u201cThe numbers are encouraging, but no one is jumping the gun and hiring up for what looks to be a boom this spring and summer,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a reluctance to get ahead of activity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve passed the point where you can just flip a switch and the lights come back on,\u201d she added. \u201cWe need to see a sustained increase in hiring, which I think we will see, but the concern is that it won\u2019t be so robust. It takes longer to ramp up than it does to shut down.\u201d\n\nUnited Airlines will add more than two dozen flights as leisure travel picks up. Most of United\u2019s new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations. Credit... Sebastian Hidalgo for The New York Times United Airlines plans to add more than two dozen new flights starting Memorial Day weekend, the latest sign that demand for leisure travel is picking up as the national vaccination rate moves higher. Most of the new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations, such as Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina; Portland, Maine; Savannah, Ga.; and Pensacola, Fla. United also said it planned to offer more flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America in May than it did during the same month in 2019. The airline has seen ticket sales rise in recent weeks, according to Ankit Gupta, United\u2019s vice president of domestic network planning and scheduling. Customers are booking tickets further out, too, he said, suggesting growing confidence in travel. \u201cOver the past 12 months, this is the first time we are really feeling more bullish,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. Airports have been consistently busier in recent weeks than at any point since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a standstill a year ago. Well over one million people were screened at airport security checkpoints each day over the past two weeks, according to the Transportation Security Administration, although the number of screenings is down more than 40 percent compared with the same period in 2019. Most of the new United flights will be offered between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend aboard the airline\u2019s regional jets, which have 50 seats. The airline said it would also add new flights between Houston and Kalispell, Mont.; Washington and Bozeman, Mont.; Chicago and Nantucket, Mass.; and Orange County, Calif., and Honolulu. All told, United said it planned to operate about 58 percent as many domestic flights this May as it did in May 2019 and 46 percent as many international flights. Most of the demand for international travel has been focused on warm beach destinations that have less-stringent travel restrictions. \u201cThat is one of the strongest demand regions in the world right now,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cA lot of the leisure traffic has sort of shifted to those places and it\u2019s actually seen a boom in bookings.\u201d Delta Air Lines issued a similar update last week, announcing more than 20 nonstop summer flights to mountain, beach and vacation destinations. Both airlines have said in recent weeks that they have made substantial progress toward reducing how much money they are losing every day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJerome Powell advocates greater diversity at the Federal Reserve. \u201cInstitutions that focus on diversity and do it well are the successful institutions in our society,\u201d said Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair. Credit... Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said on Thursday that the central bank was trying to make its economic employee base more racially diverse and he was not satisfied with its progress toward that goal so far. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating, because we have had for many years a strong focus on recruiting a more diverse cadre of economists,\u201d Mr. Powell said while speaking on NPR\u2019s \u201cMorning Edition,\u201d after being asked about a New York Times story on the Fed\u2019s lack of Black economists. \u201cWe\u2019re not at all satisfied with the results.\u201d Only two of the 417 economists, or 0.5 percent, at the Fed\u2019s board in Washington were Black, according to data the Fed provided to The Times earlier this year. By comparison, Black people make up 13 percent of the country\u2019s population and 3 to 4 percent of the U.S. citizens and permanent residents who graduate as Ph.D. economists each year. Across the entire Fed system \u2014 including the Board of Governors and the 12 regional banks \u2014 1.3 percent of economists identified as Black. The Fed has been making efforts to hire more broadly, Mr. Powell said, including by working with historically Black colleges. \u201cIt\u2019s a very high priority,\u201d Mr. Powell said of hiring more diversely. \u201cInstitutions that focus on diversity and do it well are the successful institutions in our society.\u201d The Fed chair was also asked about how he would rate the central bank\u2019s sweeping efforts to rescue the economy as markets melted down at the start of the coronavirus outbreak last year. In addition to cutting its policy interest rate to near zero and rolling out an enormous bond-buying program, the Fed set up a series of emergency lending programs to funnel credit to the economy. Rolled out over a frantic few weeks, the programs included ones that the Fed had never tried before to backstop corporate bond and private company loan markets. \u201cI liken it to Dunkirk,\u201d Mr. Powell said, referring to the rapid evacuation of British and Allied forces from France in World War II. \u201cJust get in the boats and go.\u201d Despite the speed of the decision-making, Mr. Powell said that he looked back on the results as positive. \u201cOverall, it was a very successful program,\u201d he said. \u201cIt served its purpose in staving off what could have been far worse outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not out of this yet,\u2019 Esther George of the Fed says. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said she expected inflation to \u201cfirm,\u201d given time. Credit... Ann Saphir/Reuters Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, says that although the outlook for growth has improved as vaccinations increase and the government rolls out relief packages, the path of the pandemic remains a major question hanging over the U.S. and global economies. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of this yet,\u201d Ms. George said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what the dynamics will be on the other side.\u201d Ms. George said she was focused on labor force participation as a sign of the job market\u2019s strength more than the headline unemployment rate, which has fallen to 6.2 percent from a 14.8 percent peak but misses many people who aren\u2019t looking for new jobs after losing theirs during the pandemic. Participation, the share of people working or looking, remains a hefty two percentage points below its prepandemic levels. \u201cThat might be the thing I really watch in the coming months,\u201d she said. Ms. George expects inflation to \u201cfirm,\u201d but that the process is likely to take a while, she said, and it is \u201ctoo soon to say\u201d whether it will end with a more meaningful rise. Some prominent economists have begun to warn that prices, which have been low for decades, could rise rapidly as the government spends big and the Fed keeps rates at rock bottom to support the economic recovery. \u201cWages are a very telling factor in a story about inflation,\u201d Ms. George said. Many economists look for faster growth in compensation as a signal that inflation is sustainable, not just driven by short-lived supply constraints or temporary quirks in the data. Ms. George\u2019s colleagues, including Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, have been clear that they expect prices to move higher this year but will not necessarily see that as an achievement of their inflation goal. The Fed redefined its target last year and now aims for 2 percent annual price gains, on average, over time. Ms. George did not venture a guess of when the Fed will hit its three criteria for raising interest rates: full employment, 2 percent realized price gains and the expectation of higher inflation for some time. Some Fed officials expect to raise rates next year or in 2023, but most of them expect the initial increase to come even later.

Tony Dejak/Associated Press Dan Gilbert, the Quicken Loans founder, has spent more than a decade putting billions into downtown Detroit. Now he\u2019s broadening his scope. The Gilbert Family Foundation and the Rocket Community Fund, the philanthropic arm of Quicken Loans\u2019 Rocket Mortgage company, announced on Thursday a $500 million investment in Metro Detroit, to be spent over the next 10 years. The first $15 million will be put toward paying off property tax debt of low-income homeowners who qualified for Detroit\u2019s Pay As You Stay initiative. Quicken Loans has been based in Detroit since 2010, and Mr. Gilbert and his real estate firm, Bedrock, have spent billions buying and redeveloping properties there. Those efforts have been praised for revitalizing a downtown area of roughly seven square miles, but also criticized by some who contend they did not do enough to help those who live in the rest of the city. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve made Detroit into a tech boomtown,\u201d said Mr. Gilbert. But he acknowledged that some may have felt left behind. \u201cThis can bridge that,\u201d he said. Mr. Gilbert added that his focus outside of Detroit\u2019s city center stems from his work on President Barack Obama\u2019s Blight Removal Task Force in 2014 as the city was emerging from bankruptcy. \u201cProperty taxes was the No. 1 issue that was causing the blight foreclosures,\u201d he said. Detroit\u2019s housing crisis dates to \u201cracial covenants\u201d in the 1920s. In the mid-2000s, the city became a center of risky lending that defined the financial crisis, with subprime lending accounting for three-fourths of the mortgages in the city. (Quicken Loans settled a lawsuit with the Justice Department for its own lending practices during that time, but admitted no wrongdoing.) The economic crisis that followed toppled a city already grappling with a dwindling population and shrinking revenue. Those who paid for the recovery were largely low-income housing owners \u2014 in many cases Black \u2014 whom the city was also accused of overtaxing. Poverty rates ascended and city services deteriorated as a result. The investment announced on Thursday is an effort to address the lingering effects of the crisis. Twenty thousand families qualify for the tax-relief program, said Mr. Gilbert\u2019s wife, Jennifer, who founded the Gilbert Family Foundation with her husband. \u201cBy preserving that wealth, we also preserve opportunities for intergenerational wealth transfer,\u201d she said. \u201cThe stability of the home allows for people to then focus on other economic opportunities that allow them to thrive.\u201d After the first $15 million of the initiative is spent paying back taxes of low-income homeowners, the remaining funds will be focused on, among other things, home repair and narrowing the digital divide. The community will be vital for input, including those who qualify for the initial tax relief. \u201cWe can learn a lot about where we want to invest next and how best we can positively impact them and their lives,\u201d Ms. Gilbert said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHere\u2019s what is happening in markets today.

The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite both fell less than half a percent in early trading. Stock trading has grown choppy lately as investors weigh news of rising Covid-19 cases and new lockdowns, or the rollback of efforts to reopen economies, against mounting signs of economic recovery as more people are vaccinated and the effects of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package emerge. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for unemployment benefits fell last week to 657,000, a decrease of 100,000 from the previous week. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims totaled 684,000. German lockdown U-turn As Europe grapples with an emerging third wave of the pandemic, Germany has canceled a strict five-day lockdown that was set to start at the beginning of April. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she took \u201cultimate responsibility\u201d for the reversal, which came after a large backlash to the plan, even from within her own party, and anger from retailers and restaurants. \u201cIn the near term, this avoids the negative economic consequences of a lockdown,\u201d Paul Donovan, an economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, wrote in a note. But over a longer a period of time, markets will question whether this will just delay Germany\u2019s ability to restrain the virus and slow down the recovery, he added. European stocks were lower Thursday. The Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 0.8 percent and the FTSE 100 in Britain fell 1 percent. Suez Canal Oil prices dropped. Futures of Brent crude, the European benchmark, fell 1.5 percent to $63.45 a barrel and futures of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, fell 1.8 percent to about $60 a barrel. On Wednesday, oil prices jumped more than 5 percent after a container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the world\u2019s key shipping routes, which is also an important artery for the flow of oil. On Thursday, efforts to dislodge the ship were ongoing as some 150 other ships were waiting on either side. The company trying to move the ship warned it could take weeks. Shipping has already been heavily disrupted by the pandemic, sending freight prices soaring.

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Companies harmed by the coronavirus pandemic can soon borrow up to $500,000 through the Small Business Administration\u2019s emergency lending program, raising a cap that has frustrated many applicants. \u201cThe pandemic has lasted longer than expected,\u201d Isabella Casillas Guzman, the agency\u2019s administrator, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are here to help our small businesses, and that is why I\u2019m proud to more than triple the amount of funding they can access.\u201d The change to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program \u2014 known as EIDL and pronounced as idle \u2014 will take effect the week of April 6. Those who have already received loans but might now qualify for more money will be contacted and offered the opportunity to apply for an increase, the agency said. The Small Business Administration has approved $200 billion in disaster loans to 3.8 million borrowers since the program began last year. Unlike the forgivable loans made through the larger and more prominent Paycheck Protection Program, the disaster loans must be paid back. But they carry a low interest rate and a long repayment term. Normally, the decades-old disaster program makes loans of up to $2 million, and in the early days of the pandemic, the agency gave some applicants as much as $900,000. But it soon capped loans at $150,000 because it feared exhausting the available funding. That limit \u2014 which the agency did not tell borrowers about for months \u2014 angered applicants who needed more capital to keep their struggling ventures alive. The agency has $270 billion left to lend through the pandemic relief program, James Rivera, the head of the agency\u2019s Office of Disaster Assistance, told senators at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nCatch up: Tribune Publishing\u2019s board recommends a bid from a hedge fund.

Administering the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in London on Wednesday. Credit... Dan Kitwood/Getty Images AstraZeneca reiterated on Wednesday that its Covid-19 vaccine was very effective at preventing the disease, based on more recent data than was included when the company announced the interim results of its U.S. clinical trial on Monday. The company said in a news release that its vaccine was 76 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. That is slightly lower than the number that the company announced earlier this week. The new results strengthen the scientific case for the embattled vaccine. But they may not repair the damage to AstraZeneca\u2019s credibility after U.S. health officials and independent monitors issued an extraordinary rebuke of the company for not counting some Covid-19 cases when it announced its initial findings this week. In a news release on Wednesday, the company said complete results from its 32,000-person study showed that its vaccine was 76 percent effective. On Monday, the company had said the vaccine appeared to be 79 percent effective, based on an interim look at 141 Covid-19 cases that had turned up among volunteers before Feb. 17. The latest finding was based on 190 trial participants who had gotten sick with Covid-19. AstraZeneca said on Wednesday that the vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing severe disease and 85 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 in people over age 65. When it unveiled its interim results on Monday, AstraZeneca ignored dozens of recently confirmed Covid-19 cases that had cropped up in trial volunteers before mid-February. Listen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The State of Vaccinations A look at the rapid expansion of shots, the people who are still holding out, and the rules of the road for those who are inoculated. In a letter to the company and federal officials, the independent monitoring board that was helping oversee the clinical trial issued an unusual reprimand of AstraZeneca for appearing to cherry-pick data to make its vaccine appear more effective. \u201cDecisions like this are what erode public trust in the scientific process,\u201d the letter said. The members of the monitoring board wrote that their statistical modeling had found that the vaccine might have a lower efficacy rate \u2014 between 69 and 74 percent \u2014 if the Covid-19 cases in question were included in the analysis. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases later disclosed the panel\u2019s concerns via a public statement. It was not clear why the monitoring board\u2019s projection turned out to be lower than the figure in AstraZeneca\u2019s complete results. The latest results could still change because there are still 14 possible Covid-19 cases that AstraZeneca representatives have not yet classified as actual cases. Until they received the monitoring board\u2019s letter, AstraZeneca executives weren\u2019t aware that the panel expected them to include those cases in the results disclosed in their news release, according to a person familiar with the executives\u2019 thinking. Vaccine experts said the brushback from federal officials appeared to reflect high levels of distrust between American regulators and AstraZeneca. Some worried that the episode could damage public confidence not only in AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, but in all coronavirus vaccines. \u201cThere seems to be a breakdown in relations between the D.S.M.B. and the company, which is probably due to a variety of factors and is sad,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, referring to the independent monitoring board. \u201cThis vaccine is so important for global health and the disputes do not promote global health.\u201d The dust-up over AstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. trial results followed a safety scare in Europe that prompted more than a dozen countries to temporarily suspend use of the vaccine. Regulators in Europe said last week that a review had found the shot to be safe after a small number of people who had recently been inoculated developed blood clots and abnormal bleeding. The U.S. trial did not turn up any signs of such safety problems. Rebecca Robbins and\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy is Europe having so much trouble vaccinating people? Shortages are just part of the problem. Registering for a vaccination in Milan this week. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times The European Union, where coronavirus vaccinations are moving at a maddeningly slow pace compared with those in United States and Britain, made clear this week that it is willing to flex its muscles to get more doses for its citizens, going so far as to curb exports of vaccine from the bloc. But the E.U.\u2019s trouble inoculating its population does not result from an inadequate vaccine supply alone. Bureaucratic inertia, strategic errors, a diffusion of responsibility and logistical problems in booking appointments have all helped seriously undercut vaccination efforts. Consider the northern Italian town of Cremona, an early victim during the pandemic\u2019s initial explosion in Europe. Over the weekend, the mayor got a call that the local vaccination center was empty. The region\u2019s booking system had failed to contact and set up appointments with older residents \u2014 and more than 500 doses of vaccine were at risk of going to waste. \u201cThere was staff, there were also vaccines, but there were no people,\u201d said the mayor, Gianluca Galimberti. Similar scenarios are playing out throughout the country, as the authorities struggle to get vaccines to older and vulnerable Italians who most need them. But the problems getting people vaccinated are hardly limited to Italy. The temporary suspension last week by multiple countries of the AstraZeneca vaccine, one that the European Union has bet on, was just one indication of how Europe\u2019s rollouts have been plagued by an overabundance of caution, bad deals and flouted obligations by pharmaceutical companies. The situation remains so dire that the bloc unveiled emergency restrictions to curb exports of Covid-19 vaccines for six weeks. And the Italian government, acting on a request from the European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, sent the police to inspect 29 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in a facility outside Rome, amid suspicions of possible exports out of the bloc. Italy is paying an especially heavy price for the vaccination campaign problems. A full year after the country became the first Western nation to confront the virus, it now has the dubious distinction of having the highest rate of daily deaths from Covid-19 among Europe\u2019s major powers. And the missteps have especially affected Italy\u2019s most vulnerable population: the elderly. Fewer than one in five people over 80 have received both doses of a vaccine, and less than 5 percent of septuagenarians have received their first shot. When it comes to distributing vaccines, Italy is on par with France and Germany and a little behind Spain, but its difficulties in vaccinating older citizens are far more consequential, given that it is the country with the oldest population in Europe. \u201cEvery time the phone rings, I hope it\u2019s them,\u201d said Ester Bucco, a 84-year-old resident of the Lombardy region, who registered two months ago to get vaccinated. She has yet to get an appointment.

Jan. \u201921 6 million New weekly jobless claims 4 Lowest since beginning of pandemic Pandemic Unemployment Assistance claims 2 Regular state claims Jan. \u201920 April July Oct. Jan. \u201921 While vaccination efforts have gathered speed and restrictions on activities have receded in many states, the job market is showing signs of life. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week to 657,000, a decrease of 100,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was the lowest weekly level of initial state claims since the pandemic upended the economy a year ago. On a seasonally adjusted basis, new state claims totaled 684,000. In addition, there were 242,000 new claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a federal program covering freelancers, part-timers and others who do not routinely qualify for state benefits, a decrease of 43,000. Unemployment claims have been at historically high levels for the past year, partly because some workers have been laid off more than once. Much of the drop last week was accounted for by a decline in new claims in Ohio and Illinois, but economists said the overall trend was encouraging. \u201cThis is definitely a positive signal and a move in the right direction,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. \u201cWe would expect to see further improvements as vaccines roll out and restrictions are lifted.\u201d Between the state and federal programs, the total number of new jobless claims was just under 900,000 after being stuck above one million a week. Although the pace of vaccinations, as well as passage of a $1.9 trillion relief package this month, has lifted economists\u2019 expectations for growth, the labor market has lagged behind other measures of recovery. Still, the easing of restrictions on indoor dining areas, health clubs, movie theaters and other gathering places offers hope for the millions of workers who were let go in the last 12 months. And the $1,400 checks going to most Americans as part of the relief bill should help spending perk up in the weeks ahead. Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton, said she hoped for consistent employment gains but her optimism was tempered by concern about the longer-term displacement of workers by the pandemic. \u201cThe numbers are encouraging, but no one is jumping the gun and hiring up for what looks to be a boom this spring and summer,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a reluctance to get ahead of activity.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve passed the point where you can just flip a switch and the lights come back on,\u201d she added. \u201cWe need to see a sustained increase in hiring, which I think we will see, but the concern is that it won\u2019t be so robust. It takes longer to ramp up than it does to shut down.\u201d\n\nPresident Biden is expected to discuss the pandemic today at his first news conference.

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Biden, who has said that responding to the coronavirus crisis is his No. 1 responsibility, will face reporters in his first formal news conference Thursday afternoon. In recent months, the numbers of cases and deaths in the United States have fallen, in part because of the accelerating pace of vaccinations.

Video On Thursday, the Olympic torch relay began in Fukushima, Japan, without the usual fanfare accustomed with the Games. Instead, there was a socially distanced ceremony with a procession through the street. Credit Credit... Pool photo by Philip Fong FUKUSHIMA, Japan \u2014 When Bruna Noguchi signed up to be a torchbearer for the Tokyo Olympics a year and a half ago, she never dreamed it could be a controversial decision. But as the relay kicked off on Thursday morning in Fukushima Prefecture, the ceremony and those participating in it were at the center of a national debate, with many questioning whether the Games should go on in spite of the virus, the ballooning costs and other growing challenges. While more than three dozen people, including about 20 celebrities, have withdrawn from the relay, Ms. Noguchi, 22, has decided to participate. She is one of 10,000 people who will carry the torch over the next four months, from Fukushima to Okinawa in the far south to Hokkaido in the north and on to the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. \u201cI can understand the feelings of the people who have decided to withdraw from the relay,\u201d Ms. Noguchi said in a recent interview. \u201cBut I\u2019m not worried.\u201d The Japanese authorities had envisioned the start of the torch relay as a triumphant moment, and their choice of Fukushima as the launching point was heavily symbolic. Japan is calling these Games the \u201cRecovery Olympics,\u201d highlighting the country\u2019s recovery from the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that ravaged Fukushima and other parts of northeastern Japan, as well as the world\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Seiko Hashimoto, president of the Tokyo organizing committee, said that it was \u201cvery meaningful\u201d that the relay would start in Fukushima and that she wished for \u201cthe entire world to take a look at the reconstruction done in East Japan.\u201d But the celebration on Thursday was subdued, and the relay was being carried out under a number of restrictions. Traditional Japanese drummers and a hula dance group opened the ceremony, performing before a group of around 150 attendees, who sat at socially distanced intervals and applauded politely. The ceremony and the first section of the relay were closed to the public. Routes will not be announced until 30 minutes before the start time, and spectators can attend the relay only in their home prefectures. No cheering or shouting is allowed, and fans must offer \u201csupport with applause or using distributed goods.\u201d The relay will be live-streamed by NHK, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster. Despite the precautions, some people in Fukushima said they were still worried. Shuhei Ohno, 34, a chef in Koriyama, said he feared that the torch relay might \u201craise the infection risk\u201d nationwide. \u201cThe vaccine hasn\u2019t spread widely enough in Japan yet, so how can there already be plans to host the Olympics?\u201d he said. Still, the organizers are pressing ahead. Over the next 121 days, Ms. Noguchi and her fellow torchbearers will trot across Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures, including islands off the coast of Tokyo, before completing the torch\u2019s journey on July 23, the day of the opening ceremony.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s approval ratings have recovered, powered largely by the public\u2019s enthusiasm about the vaccine rollout. Credit... Neil Hall/EPA, via Shutterstock Britain\u2019s rapid rollout of coronavirus vaccines has revived the political fortunes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Now, Mr. Johnson\u2019s allies hope the stark disparity between Britain\u2019s performance and the European Union\u2019s will do something perhaps even more challenging: vindicate their larger Brexit project. Pro-Brexit politicians and commentators are casting Britain\u2019s vaccine deployment, which ranks among the fastest in the world, as an example of risk-taking and entrepreneurial pluck that comes from not being shackled to the collective decision-making of the 27 member states of the European Union. With vaccination rates that are a fraction of Britain\u2019s, threats of export bans on vaccines produced on the continent and churlish statements about British-made vaccines by leaders like President Emmanuel Macron of France, the European Union has seemingly done all it can to make it look like Britain picked the right time to leave. \u201cBoris Johnson is going to have a vaccine dividend, and that will give him a whole new narrative for the summer and beyond,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent. It\u2019s a narrative that seeks to deflect attention from the costs of Brexit since Britain severed itself from the European Union in January \u2014 damaging disruptions to cross-channel trade and businesses choking on reams of red tape, among other headaches. And it conveniently ignores the harrowing experience many Britons had with the virus before the first vaccine \u201cjabs\u201d arrived last December. Until then, Mr. Johnson\u2019s government was known mainly for its dilatory and erratic response to the pandemic \u2014 tardy lockdowns, frequent policy reversals, muddled public messaging and a hapless test-and-trace system \u2014 all of which contributed to Britain having the highest death toll in Europe. Now, though, the prime minister\u2019s approval ratings have recovered, powered largely by the public\u2019s enthusiasm about the vaccine rollout. In a new survey, 67 percent of respondents said they thought Britain had performed better on vaccinations than E.U. countries. A slight plurality \u2014 40 percent \u2014 said they thought Brexit had helped improve Britain\u2019s handling of the pandemic, while 14 percent said it had made it worse, and 38 percent thought it had made no difference. Mr. Johnson\u2019s vaccine bounce, analysts point out, could be fleeting if a new variant emerges or if the economy does not recover swiftly. But Mr. Goodwin said one consequence of the vaccine success is that there are few signs of significant numbers of people rethinking the wisdom of Brexit or suffering the acute regret \u2014 or as he called it, \u201cBregret\u201d \u2014 that some expected.

Credit... Sebastian Hidalgo for The New York Times United Airlines plans to add more than two dozen new flights starting Memorial Day weekend, the latest sign that demand for leisure travel is picking up as the national vaccination rate moves higher. Most of the new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations, such as Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina; Portland, Maine; Savannah, Ga.; and Pensacola, Fla. United also said it planned to offer more flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America in May than it did during the same month in 2019. The airline has seen ticket sales rise in recent weeks, according to Ankit Gupta, United\u2019s vice president of domestic network planning and scheduling. Customers are booking tickets further out, too, he said, suggesting growing confidence in travel. \u201cOver the past 12 months, this is the first time we are really feeling more bullish,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. Airports have been consistently busier in recent weeks than at any point since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a standstill a year ago. Well over one million people were screened at airport security checkpoints each day over the past two weeks, according to the Transportation Security Administration, although the number of screenings is down more than 40 percent compared with the same period in 2019. Most of the new United flights will be offered between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend aboard the airline\u2019s regional jets, which have 50 seats. The airline said it would also add new flights between Houston and Kalispell, Mont.; Washington and Bozeman, Mont.; Chicago and Nantucket, Mass.; and Orange County, Calif., and Honolulu. All told, United said it planned to operate about 58 percent as many domestic flights this May as it did in May 2019 and 46 percent as many international flights. Most of the demand for international travel has been focused on warm beach destinations that have less-stringent travel restrictions. \u201cThat is one of the strongest demand regions in the world right now,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cA lot of the leisure traffic has sort of shifted to those places and it\u2019s actually seen a boom in bookings.\u201d Delta Air Lines issued a similar update last week, announcing more than 20 nonstop summer flights to mountain, beach and vacation destinations. Both airlines have said in recent weeks that they have made substantial progress toward reducing how much money they are losing every day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMississippi says it will remove \u2018misleading\u2019 advice about the vaccine. A drive-through vaccination site in Cleveland, Miss. Credit... Rory Doyle for The New York Times When Bobby Wayne, 64, called a Mississippi state hotline this week to find out where he could get the Covid-19 vaccine, he says, an operator gave him incorrect \u2014 and unnerving \u2014 information. \u201cThis is the way she put it to me: They had no documentation that the vaccine was effective,\u201d Mr. Wayne recalled. \u201cAnd then she asked me did I still want to take it.\u201d When he replied yes, the operator told him that there were no appointments available and that he should call again the next morning, he said. The Mississippi State Department of Health chalked the misinformation up to confusion, saying it was the result of \u201cmiscommunication\u201d over a misleading script given to the hotline operators. The script was referring to pregnant women, women who are lactating and people with compromised immune systems. It asked: \u201cDo you still want to be vaccinated with an understanding there are currently no available data on the safety or effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines, including Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, in pregnant people, lactating people or immunocompromised people?\u201d Most experts agree that the risks to pregnant women from Covid-19 are far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines. Doctors have also said they believe that the vaccines are safe for people with autoimmune conditions. Liz Sharlot, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said that the wording in the script could be confusing \u201cwhen read out of context.\u201d \u201cWe are replacing this confusing and misleading language,\u201d she said in a statement. However, Ms. Sharlot said the operators had never been told that there was no documented proof that the Moderna vaccine or any other vaccine authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration worked. \u201cJust the opposite is true,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth Moderna and Pfizer have high efficacy rates.\u201d Mr. Wayne\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth Wayne, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, complained on Twitter about her father\u2019s conversation with the hotline operator, equating it with \u201cviolence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Dr. Wayne said in an interview. \u201cThere is a therapy available. There is a way to treat something, and you\u2019re making it difficult for them to have access to that treatment so it\u2019s increasing the likelihood they may become sick.\u201d The Mississippi Free Press reported the story after Dr. Wayne posted about her father\u2019s experience on Twitter. Dr. Wayne said she was pleased that the health department appeared to take her concerns, and her father\u2019s, seriously. \u201cI think it was a really good example of the State Health Department trying to reach out because they actually want to restore faith\u201d in the vaccine, she said. Mr. Wayne said he got his shot on Wednesday morning. \u201cI feel a whole lot better,\u201d he said.\n\nFor a night at the theater, bring a negative coronavirus test.

Gordon Welters for The New York Times BERLIN \u2014 On a snowy, gray morning last Friday, as a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany was taking hold, Anna Schoras, 30, lined up outside a pop-up testing site inside a repurposed art gallery in Berlin. Cultural life in the German capital has largely shut down because of the virus, but if Schoras\u2019s test came back negative, she would be allowed to attend the first live stage production in the city in about five months, scheduled for that evening. \u201cI\u2019m just really looking forward to getting out of the house and to consuming live culture,\u201d she said, adding that before the pandemic, she would go to the theater or the opera about twice a month. Earlier that week, Ms. Schoras had been among the lucky few to secure one of 350 tickets to the show at the venerated Berliner Ensemble theater. They sold out in four minutes. The performance was part of a pilot project, coordinated by the city of Berlin, that allows its landmark cultural venues to put on a show in front of a live audience \u2014 as long as the audience members wear masks, maintain social distancing and present a negative result from a rapid test taken no longer than 12 hours before curtain. The test, which is included in the price of the ticket, must be administered by medically trained workers at one of five approved centers. Along with two nights at the Berliner Ensemble, live performances are being held at two of the city\u2019s opera houses, the Philharmonie and Konzerthaus, and at the Volksb\u00fchne theater.

He is expected to face questions about topics including gun control, border policy, trillions of dollars in spending and the pandemic. RIGHT NOW A Bloomberg group will spend at least $1 million pushing G.O.P. senators to pass a gun control bill.\n\nPresident Biden will hold his first news conference today. President Biden speaking to news outlets last week in Ohio. He will face reporters in his first formal news conference Thursday afternoon. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden will face reporters in his first formal news conference Thursday afternoon, using the stately backdrop of the White House to promote the benefits of his economic recovery efforts, call for action on gun control and respond to criticism about his handling of the border with Mexico. It will be Mr. Biden\u2019s first high-stakes grilling by reporters since taking office more than two months ago. Since then, his advisers have carefully controlled his interactions with the press, which have included one-on-one interviews and some limited opportunities for reporters to ask questions during brief appearances. That will not be the case in a formal news conference, which has been a White House tradition for decades. If he follows the routines established by previous presidents in both parties, Mr. Biden will pick the reporters he wants to call on, but he will have no control over the questions they ask, and his answers will be broadcast live. Here are five issues that are likely to come up. Gun Control In the wake of two mass shootings in a week, the president will probably be asked why gun control has not been a more pressing priority for his administration. While Mr. Biden has long been a proponent of gun restrictions like a ban on assault weapons, he did not issue any executive orders on the subject during his first days in office. Mr. Biden said this week that Congress should tighten background checks for gun buyers and renew the ban on assault weapons, which expired years ago. He has also said the White House is examining executive actions for him to sign that could help prevent mass shootings in the future. The Pandemic Mr. Biden has said that responding to the coronavirus crisis is his No. 1 responsibility. In recent months, the numbers of cases and deaths have fallen, in part because of the accelerating pace of vaccinations. Reporters are expected to ask him about that vaccination effort, the threat of new variants of the virus and the pressure to reopen schools over the objections of some teachers and their unions. The Border The president campaigned on reversing former President Donald J. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda, and he moved quickly to do so during his first hours in office. But the administration\u2019s handling of a surge of migrants at the border with Mexico in the last several weeks has prompted criticism that will most likely draw questions at the news conference. Reporters will most likely press Mr. Biden on how he intends to resolve the immediate issue of border facilities crowded with children. And he is expected to be asked whether his policy of a more humane immigration system than his predecessor is responsible for encouraging more migrants to leave Central America for the United States. He may also be pressed about his proposal to legalize 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States and how he intends to build support among Republicans for a comprehensive overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system. Russia Sanctions The administration is poised to announce sanctions on Russia for a series of actions, including the SolarWinds cyberattack, which compromised U.S. government agencies and companies. Mr. Biden was highly critical of his predecessor for failing to take action against Russia for its election meddling. But in the early days of his administration, the president has not acted quickly to impose broad sanctions over that attack. Reporters will probably ask why. They may also push the president on when to expect the sanctions and what he hopes they will achieve. Trillions in Spending Fresh off passage of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which is intended to help the economy recover and to finance the virus response, Mr. Biden is expected to soon propose another round of spending on climate change and infrastructure repairs that could total an additional $3 trillion. Reporters are certain to press the president on the shape of that proposal and whether he intends to try to build Republican support for it. Mr. Biden passed the American Rescue Plan with only Democratic support thanks to a procedural loophole in the Senate. Reporters will want to know whether he plans to use that same maneuver again as he pushes for his broader agenda.\n\nHere\u2019s how to watch Biden\u2019s news conference.

Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Biden will hold his first formal news conference as president on Thursday. The news conference is expected to touch on a wide array of issues, including the pandemic, the recently enacted $1.9 trillion stimulus package, immigration and \u2014 especially in the wake of deadly shootings in Georgia and Colorado \u2014 policies to reduce gun violence. Thursday is Mr. Biden\u2019s 64th day in office, which is unusually late for a president in modern times to hold his first formal news conference, though he has periodically answered questions from the news media in more informal settings.

A makeshift memorial at the King Soopers grocery store in Boulder, Colo., where a mass shooting on Monday left 10 dead. Credit... Stephen Speranza for The New York Times While President Biden considers a gamut of executive and legislative actions on gun control in the wake of two mass shootings, the federal agency tasked with enforcing existing gun laws remains without a permanent leader and hobbled by restrictions on its enforcement power. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or A.T.F., has long been the target of a campaign by the National Rifle Association and its legislative allies to weaken oversight of gun purchases. \u201cIt is hard to think of any federal agency that has been so completely handcuffed as the A.T.F. has been by the N.R.A. and its friends in Congress,\u201d said Adam Winkler, a professor of constitutional law specializing in gun statutes at the University of California, Los Angeles. Mr. Biden, who made an emotional appeal on Tuesday for Congress to enact gun control legislation, has not yet picked a nominee to lead the agency. White House officials said they had no timetable for doing so, but two administration officials with knowledge of the situation said that several potential candidates were being interviewed \u2014 although no names have yet been floated on Capitol Hill or among advocacy groups, according to the officials. \u201cThe administration is going to revitalize A.T.F. and ensure that our guns laws are vigorously enforced,\u201d said Michael Gwin, a Biden spokesman. Still, the delay in naming a director is emblematic of the enormous practical and political challenges that come with efforts to make any significant changes at the agency. Over the last two decades, Republicans, with the support of conservative Democrats, have embedded into spending bills riders intended to constrain the bureau, including limits on unannounced inspections of gun dealers, prohibitions on documenting the inventories of gun shops and an especially damaging provision that bars the agency from digitizing its records. Gun rights groups say such steps are necessary to keep the A.T.F. from mounting an \u201cassault\u201d on the rights of gun owners. But critics consider it part of an effort to shield gun companies and owners from oversight and responsibility. \u201cWhat\u2019s been done to the A.T.F. is systemic, it\u2019s intentional, and it\u2019s a huge problem,\u201d said T. Christian Heyne of Brady: United Against Gun Violence, a gun-control group that has proposed a plan for executive action on the issue centered on stepped-up enforcement by the agency. Mr. Biden is expected to roll out a series of executive orders related to gun violence in the coming weeks. Almost all of the orders require a significant expansion of A.T.F. enforcement. But even naming someone to lead the agency is a headache. In 2006, N.R.A.-allied lawmakers enacted a provision making the position of A.T.F. director, which had previously been a political appointment, subject to Senate confirmation. As a result, only one director has been confirmed over the last 15 years: the Obama nominee B. Todd Jones. Regina Lombardo, a well-regarded agency veteran who helped direct the federal response to the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando in 2016, has served as acting director since early 2019. She got the job after former President Donald J. Trump, who ran on a defiantly pro-gun platform, withdrew the nomination of a former top police union official, Chuck Canterbury, after the nominee refused to entirely rule out expanding background checks and other safeguards. The agency\u2019s potential power was another reason Mr. Canterbury failed. One of Mr. Trump\u2019s closest allies, Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, opposed him, warning that Mr. Canterbury might use the bureau\u2019s authority to more strictly enforce gun laws.\n\nA Bloomberg group will spend at least $1 million pushing G.O.P. senators to pass a gun control bill.

Chet Strange for The New York Times The gun control organization backed by Michael R. Bloomberg will soon begin a national advertising campaign aimed at pressuring Republican senators to support measures that would strengthen and expand background checks for gun buyers. The campaign by the group, Everytown for Gun Safety, comes after two mass shootings in less than a week killed eight people at spas in Georgia and 10 at a supermarket in Boulder, Colo. The organization\u2019s political arm plans to kick off the campaign in April with $1 million to $1.5 million in television and digital advertisements. John Feinblatt, Everytown\u2019s president, said the ads would target Republican senators including Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Susan Collins of Maine, who backed the failed 2013 effort to expand background checks, along with \u201ca number of retiring senators\u201d who have opposed new gun control measures in the past. Mr. Feinblatt said the campaign was aimed at securing the 60 votes needed for the Senate to pass gun control proposals that have already passed the House, which include expanding federal background checks for new gun purchases. It will not ask Democratic senators to alter the filibuster rules to pass any measure with a simple majority vote. \u201cEvery senator needs to know how urgent this matter is, and every senator needs to know we mean business about seizing the moment and getting the bills passed,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said on Wednesday. \u201cThis is about getting 60 votes, which we think is entirely possible because the political calculus has changed.\u201d Everytown has become the biggest player in gun control politics in recent years. The organization spent about $55 million backing Democratic candidates in 2020. Mr. Feinblatt said the campaign would continue until the Senate sent the measures to President Biden, who called on Tuesday not only for background checks but also for an assault weapons ban. Such a ban has not received a serious debate in Congress, and Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s organization is not pushing it at the moment. \u201cWe will stick with this until there\u2019s a vote,\u201d Mr. Feinblatt said. \u201cI don\u2019t know when that vote will take place, but I know that we will spend what it takes for as long as it takes.\u201d\n\nVirginia becomes the first southern state to abolish the death penalty.

Credit... Steve Helber/Associated Press Gov. Ralph S. Northam on Wednesday signed a bill that abolished the death penalty in Virginia, making it the first Southern state and the 23rd overall to end capital punishment amid rising opposition to the practice. Before signing the bill, Mr. Northam pointed to Virginia\u2019s 413-year history of capital punishment, during which it executed more than 1,300 inmates, more than any other state. He also noted racial disparities in the use of the death penalty: During the 20th century, he said, 296 of the 377 inmates Virginia executed for murder \u2014 or about 79 percent \u2014 were Black. \u201cEnding the death penalty comes down to one fundamental question, one question: Is it fair?\u201d Mr. Northam said after he completed a tour of the state\u2019s execution chamber. \u201cFor the state to apply this ultimate, final punishment, the answer needs to be yes. Fair means that it is applied equally to anyone, no matter who they are. And fair means that we get it right, that the person punished for the crime did the crime.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d he added, \u201cwe all know that the death penalty cannot meet those criteria.\u201d The bill\u2019s signing comes as President Biden faces pressure from members of his own party to commute the sentences of the remaining inmates on federal death row. It also follows a spate of executions carried out by the Trump administration that renewed calls from the left to abolish capital punishment. If Virginia is any indication, Republican support for abolishing capital punishment at the federal level is unlikely. The move has been criticized by some in the party who resent the compassion shown for perpetrators of heinous crimes. During a hearing in the Virginia House of Delegates last month, Delegate Robert B. Bell, a Republican, noted that two people watched the debate over the death penalty with \u201crapt attention\u201d: Anthony Juniper and Thomas A. Porter, the last two men on Virginia\u2019s death row. Both were convicted of grisly murders. The bill, which the Virginia House and Senate passed last month, stipulates that the sentences of the remaining death row inmates be converted to life in prison without eligibility for parole.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHarris will work with Central American countries to reduce migration.

But the vice president\u2019s agreed, among the multiple other things that happed to be needed \u2014 and I appreciate it \u2014 agreed to lead our diplomatic effort, and work with those nations to accept the returnees and enhance migration enforcement at their borders, at their borders.

And there\u2019s no question that this is a challenging situation. As the president has said, there are many factors that lead residents to leave these countries. And while we are clear that people should not come to the border now, we also understand that we will enforce the law, and that we also \u2014 because we can chew gum and walk at the same time \u2014 let\u2019s address the root causes that cause people to make the trek, as the president has described, to come here.\u201d On Wednesday, President Biden announced that Vice President Kamala Harris would be in charge of finding ways to improve conditions in Central American countries with the goal of reducing arrivals of migrants at the U.S. border. Credit Credit... John Moore/Getty Images Vice President Kamala Harris will be in charge of efforts to reduce illegal immigration by finding ways to improve conditions in Central American countries, President Biden said Wednesday as his administration struggles to confront a surge of migrants at the country\u2019s southern border. \u201cThis new surge we are dealing with now started in the past administration, but it is our responsibility\u201d now to deal with it, Mr. Biden said as he made the announcement during a meeting with top immigration advisers. He called the vice president the most qualified person to deal with Mexico and Central American countries as they try to limit what he called \u201cserious spikes\u201d in the number of people trying to cross the border illegally. The announcement puts Ms. Harris in the middle of one of the most charged and contentious issues for the White House, which has scrambled to find space for thousands of minors who have crossed the border without their parents in recent weeks. Mr. Biden said that Ms. Harris would oversee the administration\u2019s plans to pump billions of dollars into the ravaged economies of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in the hopes of reducing the violence and poverty that often drive families in those countries to seek refuge in the United States. Ms. Harris said that there was \u201cno question this is a challenging situation,\u201d but that she was looking forward to engaging in discussions with leaders of Central American countries. For Ms. Harris, the diplomatic assignment is one of the first in a portfolio of responsibilities that aides said would continue to expand in the months ahead. They noted that Mr. Biden, as vice president under President Barack Obama, had been in charge of working to improve conditions in the same Central American countries. The task is likely to be a difficult one. Mr. Biden\u2019s efforts in Central America were largely unsuccessful, as critics charged that corrupt leaders there had not effectively spent foreign aid money. In the years since, the countries have grown more dangerous and more economically unstable. Now, Ms. Harris will face similar challenges in an even more heated political environment. Republicans have seized on the surge of migrants at the border as evidence that Mr. Biden\u2019s immigration policies are failing. Aides sought to describe the vice president\u2019s role as limited to working on long-term improvements in Central America. But it may be difficult for Ms. Harris to avoid political blame for the administration\u2019s broader immigration agenda if her efforts fail to significantly stem the flow of migrants arriving at the southern border of the United States in the short term. Ms. Harris said on Wednesday that she expected to travel to the border in the coming weeks, but did not provide details. Aides declined to say when she would make a trip to Central America or discuss the immigration issue with the leaders of the nations she will work with.", "article_body_bow": [[1, 0.28316384797299804], [2, 0.12137347109793101], [3, 0.022135699178005577], [4, 0.08459069242804927], [5, 0.8650410377483347], [6, 0.050884766926372636], [7, 0.18202340493711539], [8, 0.024271877257627812], [10, 0.06951706706478397], [11, 0.02317235568826132], [12, 0.020224822770790598], [13, 0.12135938628813907], [15, 0.04634471137652264], [16, 0.1992212926020502], [18, 0.17809668424230424], [19, 0.1272119173159316], [21, 0.050884766926372636]]}, {"author": ["Somini Sengupta", "Geneva Abdul", "Manuela Andreoni", "Veronica Penney"], "title": "Riders Are Abandoning Buses and Trains.

A man who had returned to Toronto from Wuhan, China tested positive for the virus. His wife tested positive a day later.\n\nQuebec soon became the province most severely affected, likely because its winter school break, which saw many families travel to the southern United States and other warm weather destinations, occurred two weeks before provincial lockdown measures began to sweep the country in mid-March.\n\nUntil late in the fall, British Columbia, on the Pacific Coast, and the four provinces in Atlantic Canada generally fared the best in the country at controlling the virus which abated over the summer leading to a relaxation of restrictions across the country. The Atlantic provinces, however, continued to require anyone entering from the rest of Canada to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nAs with the first round of the pandemic, long term care homes have been hard hit in many provinces by the return of the virus. British Columbia also saw its once enviable record for controlling the virus evaporate.\n\nFor most of the year, the pandemic generally had not been a partisan issue nor did it feature that rancor that usually characterizes relations between provinces and the federal government. But in late October Mr. Trudeau\u2019s Conservative opponents and several premiers who lead right of center governments began repeatedly charging that the government has no clear plans or timelines for vaccine distribution, an allegation Mr. Trudeau rejects.\n\nOn March 21, Canada closed its border with the United States, with exceptions for freight movements and some essential workers. It was the first time the entire border had been shut since Canada became a nation in 1867. In early December, Mr. Trudeau said that the virus will have to be brought under control worldwide before it reopens.\n\nMany parts of Canada saw the return of restrictions in November as politicians and officials urged residents to not gather during the holiday season.\n\nHow Cases Are Growing\n\nHere\u2019s how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nNew reported cases by day 0 10,000 20,000 cases Feb. 2020 Mar.

And though it is technically illegal to threaten or fire workers who take part in an organizing campaign, employers face minimal punishment for doing so.\n\nLabor board cases can drag on for years, after which an employer frequently must only post a notice promising to abide by labor law in the future, said Wilma B. Liebman, a former board chairwoman. There are no monetary penalties for such violations, though workers can be made whole through back pay.\n\nThe PRO Act would outlaw mandatory anti-union meetings, enact financial penalties for threatening or firing workers and help wrongly terminated workers win quick reinstatement.
