Some people on Twitter were shocked by it, but otherwise you\u2019d never really know it happened.\n\nDUCKWORTH BACKTRACKS AFTER SAYING SHE'S DONE VOTING FOR BIDEN NOMINEES OVER LACK OF AAPI REPRESENTATION\n\nBut it did happen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii publicly informed the White House that until the Biden administration puts more people they like in powerful jobs, they will refuse to confirm White nominees.\n\n\"I am a no vote on the floor on all non-diversity nominees,\" Duckworth said, out loud, with cameras rolling. \"I will vote for racial minorities and I will vote for LGBTQ, but anybody else, I\u2019m not voting for.\"\n\nJust in case you missed it, or were unclear on the meaning, Duckworth said this several times. And then Mazie Hirono backed her up.\n\nSEN. MAZIE HIRONO: Tammy\u2019s position is that until she gets a commitment from the White House that there will be more diversity representation in the Cabinet and senior White House advisory positions, she will not vote to confirm anyone who does not represent diversity. So this is not about pitting one diversity group against another. I think this is a well-articulated, focused position, and I am prepared to join her in that.\n\nALEX WAGNER, MSNBC: Do you think the Biden administration has been adequately receptive to your entreaties for more diversity?\n\nHIRONO: Obviously not, otherwise Tammy and I wouldn\u2019t be taking our position. We would like to encourage them to do better.\n\nSo here you have two actual U.S. senators announcing in public they will deny jobs to people who have the wrong skin color. That\u2019s not news? Oh yes, it is news, though Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth may not realize it\u2019s news. In their defense, Hirono and Duckworth are well-known as the dimmest politicians in Washington. Neither one could carry a dinner conversation. But not everyone in Congress is stupid or oblivious.\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., certainly isn\u2019t. The Senate Majority Leader misses nothing. Chuck Schumer has spent his entire life telling us at high volume that racial discrimination is wrong, which obviously it is. Then, this week, two of his colleagues went on television to demand racial discrimination. What did Chuck Schumer think of that? Schumer didn\u2019t say a word about it. No one in the Democratic Party did.\n\nMATT WALSH ACCUSES HIRONO, DUCKWORTH OF 'ANTI-WHITE RACISM'\n\nThese are moral pygmies. Some of them would sell their kids if the price was right. Some of them are actually race haters, probably, and they agree with it. But whatever their motives, the fact that his happened in public and no one in power said anything about it seems like a turning point in the history of our country.\n\nTo recap the most basic principle we have: All Americans have an inalienable right, given by God and guaranteed by the Constitution, to be judged solely and exclusively on the basis of what they do and of what they choose. Not on the basis of their race, or their genes or who their parents were. That is the entire promise of the country. It\u2019s why we\u2019re different. It\u2019s why people move here from other countries. It\u2019s why we\u2019re a self-governing republic, because everyone is equal.\n\nIt\u2019s also, in addition to everything else, federal law. It\u2019s written down. What Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth did is not simply morally repugnant (although it is). It\u2019s also illegal.\n\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act opens this way, \"No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n\nYou cannot deny an American a federal job because of his race. That is against the law, and has been for nearly 60 years.\n\nRacial discrimination in government hiring is a crime. You may have heard that before. It\u2019s on the wall of every break room in every office in the United States. In fact, the Civil Rights Act may be the most famous law we have. But then, as now, many prominent Democrats opposed it. Critical race theory is not a new idea, despite what they tell you. In 1964, a third of Senate Democrats voted against the Civil Rights Act. One of those who did was a man called Robert Byrd.\n\nByrd was a strident supporter of \"equity\" \u2014 or, as it was called at the time, Jim Crow. In 1944, at the height of the Second World War, Robert Byrd wrote a letter to Theodore Bilbo, who represented Mississippi in the Senate. Byrd was upset that the Roosevelt administration was giving federal jobs to people with the wrong skin color. Robert Byrd was the Tammy Duckworth of his day.\n\n\"I shall never fight in the armed forces with a Negro by my side,\" Byrd wrote, amazingly. \"Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.\"\n\nTUCKER CARLSON VOWS HE WILL 'NOT BE SILENCED' IN FOX NATION VIDEO PODCAST PREVIEW\n\nThat\u2019s real. Robert Byrd wrote that. At the time, he was working as a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan, which was very much the Yale University of the time, the source of so much poison in our society. Two years later, Byrd wrote to a well-known critical race theorist called Joel Baskin, who was serving as the grand wizard of their beloved organization.\n\n\"The Klan is needed today as never before,\" Byrd wrote, \"and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia. It is necessary that the [Klan] be promoted immediately and in every state in the Union. Will you please inform me as to the possibilities of rebuilding the Klan realm of West Virginia?\"\n\nOnce again, that\u2019s real.\n\nShortly after he wrote that, Byrd abandoned his Klan career, which never paid well. Instead he decided to run for office as a Democrat. Robert Byrd served in Congress for nearly 60 years. When Byrd died, during Barack Obama\u2019s first term, the entire leadership of the Democratic Party came forward to slobber over his memory \u2014 including, amazingly, Barack Obama himself.\n\nEX-CNN PRODUCER CALLS FOR NETWORK TO 'STEP IN' AND STOP DON LEMON'S 'DANGEROUS' RHETORIC\n\n\"It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd,\" said Hillary Clinton. \"He was not just its longest-serving member, he was its heart and soul. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance.\"\n\nOf course Hillary Clinton said that.\n\n\"While some simply bore witness to history,\" remarked an emotional Nancy Pelosi, \"Senator Byrd shaped it and strove to build a brighter future for us all.\"\n\nVice President Joe Biden, always big on memorials, went on perhaps the longest. Biden described Robert Byrd as \"a very close friend of mine, one of my mentors.\" Joe Biden even misquoted William Shakespeare as he celebrated his Klansman mentor.\n\nFLASHBACK: AMID PUSH TO REMOVE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS, LITTLE OUTRAGE OVER ROBERT BYRD'S NAMESAKES IN HOME STATE\n\nBIDEN: When I learned of his death, I was on an errand for the President in Cleveland, and I said, you know, to paraphrase the poet, we shall not see his like again ... Mr. Leader, we\u2019re not going to look upon your like again. I\u2019m not even going to ask God to bless you because he already had and I know where you are.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" you\u2019re thinking, \"that was a long time ago, and Biden probably doesn\u2019t even remember. That was way back in the summer of 2010, when people just didn\u2019t know any better. They thought the Ku Klux Klan was some sort of harmless fraternal organization, like the Elks, or Rotary.\" Right.\n\nNo, they knew. Underneath it all, they never really disagreed with the core idea. Only the colors have changed. There exists in the darkest parts of human nature the instinct to form a mob and attack other people for how they were born. \"Fear of the other,\" is what sociologists call it. They say it\u2019s a function of evolutionary biology.\n\nWhoever it comes from, however you describe the phenomenon, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s a grave threat to America. This is an enormous, complex \u2014 and, yes, diverse \u2014 society. We have very little in common with each other, apart from the fact we\u2019re all Americans. There are 350 million people living within the borders of our country. Most of us can\u2019t leave, so we have to live together. If you want Americans to live peacefully without hurting each other, you have to treat them as individuals, not as members of warring tribes. You have to guarantee every American identical opportunities to work and live and go to school, as well as identical judgement under the law. Equality under the law.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW BLASTS BIDEN BLAMING BORDER CRISIS ON TRUMP: 'NOBODY BUYS IT'\n\nYou can\u2019t just announce that Americans of a certain color can\u2019t have jobs. If you do that, things will tend to fall apart very quickly. We fought a war over this once, by the way, one that killed 700,000 people.\n\nNot that long ago, all Americans understood this. But then a new generation of Robert Byrds took control of the Democratic Party, and dark and primitive forces have been unleashed. You see them everywhere, so you hardly need to be reminded, but here\u2019s one example: The Nation magazine, the flagship publication of the American left, just ran a piece with this title: \"I Am Not Ready to Reenter White Society.\"\n\nIt was written by a Harvard Law graduate named Elie Mystal. The open reads, \"I\u2019ve said, here and elsewhere, that one of the principal benefits of the pandemic is how I\u2019ve been able to exclude racism and [W]hiteness generally from my day-to-day life. Over the past year, I have, of course, still had to interact with [W]hite people on Zoom or watch them on television or worry about whether they would succeed in reelecting a [W]hite-supremacist president. But [W]hite people aren\u2019t in my face all of the time. I can, more or less, only deal with [W]hiteness when I want to ... White people haven\u2019t improved; I\u2019ve just been able to limit my exposure to them.\"\n\nThat\u2019s someone who went to Harvard Law School. That\u2019s not normal, and it\u2019s not healthy. It\u2019s open race hate, and it\u2019s the beginning of our actual destruction. As with Senators Hirono and Duckworth, no one in power says a word about it. So naturally, exhibitions like that accelerate and it becomes more dangerous.\n\nLast week, a corporate-owned website called The Root published a kind of terrorist manifesto written by a New York Times contributor named Damon Young.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe tract begins like this: \"Whiteness is a public health crisis. It shortens life expectancies, it pollutes air, it constricts equilibrium, it devastates forests, it melts ice caps, it sparks (and funds) wars, it flattens dialects, it infests consciousness, and it kills people.\"\n\nWith that established, Young wrote this: \"White supremacy is a virus that, like other viruses, will not die until there are no bodies left for it to infect. Which means the only way to stop it is to locate it, isolate it, extract it, and kill it.\"\n\n\"And kill it.\" You have to ask yourself, where is this going?

That was the answer to the question.\"\n\nAt the same hearing, U.S. Sen.
