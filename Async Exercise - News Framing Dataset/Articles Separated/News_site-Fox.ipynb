And then Mazie Hirono backed her up.\\n\\nSEN. MAZIE HIRONO: Tammy’s position is that until she gets a commitment from the White House that there will be more diversity representation in the Cabinet and senior White House advisory positions, she will not vote to confirm anyone who does not represent diversity. So this is not about pitting one diversity group against another. I think this is a well-articulated, focused position, and I am prepared to join her in that.\\n\\nALEX WAGNER, MSNBC: Do you think the Biden administration has been adequately receptive to your entreaties for more diversity?\\n\\nHIRONO: Obviously not, otherwise Tammy and I wouldn’t be taking our position.

Oh yes, it is news, though Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth may not realize it’s news. In their defense, Hirono and Duckworth are well-known as the dimmest politicians in Washington. Neither one could carry a dinner conversation. But not everyone in Congress is stupid or oblivious.\\n\\nSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., certainly isn’t. The Senate Majority Leader misses nothing. Chuck Schumer has spent his entire life telling us at high volume that racial discrimination is wrong, which obviously it is.

No one in the Democratic Party did.\\n\\nMATT WALSH ACCUSES HIRONO, DUCKWORTH OF \\'ANTI-WHITE RACISM\\'\\n\\nThese are moral pygmies. Some of them would sell their kids if the price was right. Some of them are actually race haters, probably, and they agree with it. But whatever their motives, the fact that his happened in public and no one in power said anything about it seems like a turning point in the history of our country.\\n\\nTo recap the most basic principle we have: All Americans have an inalienable right, given by God and guaranteed by the Constitution, to be judged solely and exclusively on the basis of what they do and of what they choose. Not on the basis of their race, or their genes or who their parents were. That is the entire promise of the country. It’s why we’re different. It’s why people move here from other countries. It’s why we’re a self-governing republic, because everyone is equal.\\n\\nIt’s also, in addition to everything else, federal law. It’s written down. What Mazie Hirono and Tammy Duckworth did is not simply morally repugnant (although it is). It’s also illegal.\\n\\nTitle VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act opens this way, \"No person in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\\n\\nYou cannot deny an American a federal job because of his race. That is against the law, and has been for nearly 60 years.\\n\\nRacial discrimination in government hiring is a crime. You may have heard that before. It’s on the wall of every break room in every office in the United States. In fact, the Civil Rights Act may be the most famous law we have. But then, as now, many prominent Democrats opposed it. Critical race theory is not a new idea, despite what they tell you. In 1964, a third of Senate Democrats voted against the Civil Rights Act. One of those who did was a man called Robert Byrd.\\n\\nByrd was a strident supporter of \"equity\" — or, as it was called at the time, Jim Crow. In 1944, at the height of the Second World War, Robert Byrd wrote a letter to Theodore Bilbo, who represented Mississippi in the Senate. Byrd was upset that the Roosevelt administration was giving federal jobs to people with the wrong skin color. Robert Byrd was the Tammy Duckworth of his day.\\n\\n\"I shall never fight in the armed forces with a Negro by my side,\" Byrd wrote, amazingly. \"Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.\"\\n\\nTUCKER CARLSON VOWS HE WILL \\'NOT BE SILENCED\\' IN FOX NATION VIDEO PODCAST PREVIEW\\n\\nThat’s real. Robert Byrd wrote that. At the time, he was working as a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan, which was very much the Yale University of the time, the source of so much poison in our society. Two years later, Byrd wrote to a well-known critical race theorist called Joel Baskin, who was serving as the grand wizard of their beloved organization.\\n\\n\"The Klan is needed today as never before,\" Byrd wrote, \"and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia. It is necessary that the [Klan] be promoted immediately and in every state in the Union. Will you please inform me as to the possibilities of rebuilding the Klan realm of West Virginia?\"\\n\\nOnce again, that’s real.\\n\\nShortly after he wrote that, Byrd abandoned his Klan career, which never paid well. Instead he decided to run for office as a Democrat. Robert Byrd served in Congress for nearly 60 years. When Byrd died, during Barack Obama’s first term, the entire leadership of the Democratic Party came forward to slobber over his memory — including, amazingly, Barack Obama himself.\\n\\nEX-CNN PRODUCER CALLS FOR NETWORK TO \\'STEP IN\\' AND STOP DON LEMON\\'S \\'DANGEROUS\\' RHETORIC\\n\\n\"It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd,\" said Hillary Clinton. \"He was not just its longest-serving member, he was its heart and soul. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance.\"\\n\\nOf course Hillary Clinton said that.\\n\\n\"While some simply bore witness to history,\" remarked an emotional Nancy Pelosi, \"Senator Byrd shaped it and strove to build a brighter future for us all.\"\\n\\nVice President Joe Biden, always big on memorials, went on perhaps the longest. Biden described Robert Byrd as \"a very close friend of mine, one of my mentors.\" Joe Biden even misquoted William Shakespeare as he celebrated his Klansman mentor.\\n\\nFLASHBACK: AMID PUSH TO REMOVE CONFEDERATE MONUMENTS, LITTLE OUTRAGE OVER ROBERT BYRD\\'S NAMESAKES IN HOME STATE\\n\\nBIDEN: When I learned of his death, I was on an errand for the President in Cleveland, and I said, you know, to paraphrase the poet, we shall not see his like again ... Mr. Leader, we’re not going to look upon your like again. I’m not even going to ask God to bless you because he already had and I know where you are.\"\\n\\n\"Oh,\" you’re thinking, \"that was a long time ago, and Biden probably doesn’t even remember. That was way back in the summer of 2010, when people just didn’t know any better. They thought the Ku Klux Klan was some sort of harmless fraternal organization, like the Elks, or Rotary.\" Right.\\n\\nNo, they knew. Underneath it all, they never really disagreed with the core idea. Only the colors have changed. There exists in the darkest parts of human nature the instinct to form a mob and attack other people for how they were born. \"Fear of the other,\" is what sociologists call it. They say it’s a function of evolutionary biology.\\n\\nWhoever it comes from, however you describe the phenomenon, it’s real, and it’s a grave threat to America. This is an enormous, complex — and, yes, diverse — society. We have very little in common with each other, apart from the fact we’re all Americans. There are 350 million people living within the borders of our country. Most of us can’t leave, so we have to live together. If you want Americans to live peacefully without hurting each other, you have to treat them as individuals, not as members of warring tribes. You have to guarantee every American identical opportunities to work and live and go to school, as well as identical judgement under the law. Equality under the law.\\n\\nLARRY KUDLOW BLASTS BIDEN BLAMING BORDER CRISIS ON TRUMP: \\'NOBODY BUYS IT\\'\\n\\nYou can’t just announce that Americans of a certain color can’t have jobs. If you do that, things will tend to fall apart very quickly. We fought a war over this once, by the way, one that killed 700,000 people.\\n\\nNot that long ago, all Americans understood this. But then a new generation of Robert Byrds took control of the Democratic Party, and dark and primitive forces have been unleashed. You see them everywhere, so you hardly need to be reminded, but here’s one example: The Nation magazine, the flagship publication of the American left, just ran a piece with this title: \"I Am Not Ready to Reenter White Society.\"\\n\\nIt was written by a Harvard Law graduate named Elie Mystal. The open reads, \"I’ve said, here and elsewhere, that one of the principal benefits of the pandemic is how I’ve been able to exclude racism and [W]hiteness generally from my day-to-day life. Over the past year, I have, of course, still had to interact with [W]hite people on Zoom or watch them on television or worry about whether they would succeed in reelecting a [W]hite-supremacist president. But [W]hite people aren’t in my face all of the time. I can, more or less, only deal with [W]hiteness when I want to ... White people haven’t improved; I’ve just been able to limit my exposure to them.\"\\n\\nThat’s someone who went to Harvard Law School. That’s not normal, and it’s not healthy. It’s open race hate, and it’s the beginning of our actual destruction. As with Senators Hirono and Duckworth, no one in power says a word about it. So naturally, exhibitions like that accelerate and it becomes more dangerous.\\n\\nLast week, a corporate-owned website called The Root published a kind of terrorist manifesto written by a New York Times contributor named Damon Young.\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\nThe tract begins like this: \"Whiteness is a public health crisis. It shortens life expectancies, it pollutes air, it constricts equilibrium, it devastates forests, it melts ice caps, it sparks (and funds) wars, it flattens dialects, it infests consciousness, and it kills people.\"\\n\\nWith that established, Young wrote this: \"White supremacy is a virus that, like other viruses, will not die until there are no bodies left for it to infect. Which means the only way to stop it is to locate it, isolate it, extract it, and kill it.\"\\n\\n\"And kill it.\" You have to ask yourself, where is this going? Let’s pull back now before we find out.\\n\\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson\\'s opening commentary on the March 24, 2021 edition of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"'},\n",

Roy Blunt, R-Mo., blasted Democrats for what he described as a \"false narrative\" regarding voter suppression allegations.\\n\\nThe Senate Rules Committee was debating the For the People Act, a federal voting rights proposal sponsored by the panel’s chairwoman, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.\\n\\n\"The bill simply tries to make it easier to vote,\" Klobuchar said, according to the Star Tribune of Minneapolis. \"The For the People Act is the best chance to stop the rollback of voting rights.\"\\n\\nBut during his questioning of witness Michael Waldman of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, Blunt alleged that the Klobuchar-backed proposal was an attempt to federalize elections under the guise of trying to protect voters’ rights.\\n\\nSENATE SET FOR CLASH ON HOT-BUTTON ELECTIONS BILL DEMS SAY BOOSTS VOTING RIGHTS, GOP DECRIES AS POWER GRAB\\n\\nBlunt asserted that lawmakers have frequently introduced similar legislation over the years, only to see plan after plan fail to become law.\\n\\n\"It’s a great excuse to upend a system that’s served the country well for a long time,\" Blunt said, referring to local control of elections.\\n\\nThe senator then asked Waldman why his group has suggested one state’s effort to remove the names of dead people from voter rolls would be an example of voter suppression.\\n\\n\"Because there are frequently errors in the lists that are used in Social Security and other …\" Waldman began, before Blunt interjected.\\n\\n\"So your view would be, the federal government is not capable of telling the state which Social Security recipients died and no longer get a check, so we should turn the entire election over to a federal structure. I just don’t agree …\"\\n\\nKlobuchar then interrupted: \"Senator Blunt, can we allow the witness to answer the question, please?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" Blunt replied.\\n\\n\"No? No?\" Klobuchar responded.\\n\\nBlunt then explained why he thought Waldman had adequately addressed his inquiry.\\n\\n\"The witness did answer the question,\" Blunt said. \"Senator, the witness answered the question by saying the federal government often is in error in giving information to the states. That was the answer to the question.\"\\n\\nAt the same hearing, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asserted that Democrats planned to use same-day and automatic voter-registration programs so that \"millions of illegal aliens\" and \"criminals\" could obtain the right to vote, the Star Tribune reported.\\n\\nSenate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., got into a brief clash over the Democrats\\' plan.\\n\\n\"I would like to ask my Republican colleagues, why are you so afraid of democracy? Schumer asked, according to CNBC. \"Why, instead of trying to win voters over, that you lost in the last elections, are you trying to prevent them from voting?\\n\\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\\n\\n\"Shame, shame shame,\" Schumer added.\\n\\n\"Talk about shame,\" McConnell countered. \"If anybody ought to be feeling any shame around here, it\\'s turning the FEC[Federal Elections Commission] into a partisan prosecutor. The majority controlled by the president\\'s party to harass and intimidate the other side -- that\\'s what you ought to be ashamed about.\"\\n\\nThe Democrat-controlled House previously passed its voter rights legislation earlier this month, with no support from Republicans.'},\n",
