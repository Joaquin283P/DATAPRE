Hi.\n\nwesley morris\n\nHow are you?\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, we\u2019re back, and we\u2019re still in a personal pan pizza, which is what I\u2019m going to call the pandemic, because I gotta take my joy where I can.\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh my god.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut it\u2019s been a year, and we\u2019re still on the pancetta. We\u2019re in the pon de replay. And I\u2019m holding on. I\u2019m doing my very best. How about you?\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh, man. I am doing my best myself.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd one thing that keeps me out of trouble is not going to the gym.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat\u2019s right.\n\nwesley morris\n\nSo haven\u2019t been to the gym in a year.\n\njenna wortham\n\nGood.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd just working out in my living room.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd I recently had a friend give me his login for Peloton.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat\u2019s a nice friend.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI don\u2019t have a bike or anything, so I\u2019ve just been using the app for strength training. And I decided almost immediately who I knew I wanted to have my instructor be. There\u2019s a guy named Adrian Williams. He is a handsome Black man with a little salt-and-pepper goatee. And I take his 45-minute full body strength class on Martin Luther King Day. All I can see on the screen is Adrian. All of the other people in the class, I don\u2019t know. I mean, they\u2019re avatars. I don\u2019t know who else is in this class.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd chances are the vast majority of the people in your Zoom workout class are not going to be people of color.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t break down that way.\n\nwesley morris\n\nIt just doesn\u2019t break down like that in real life, and I\u2019m assuming it just does not break down that way at Peloton. And Adrian, he picks the soundtrack.\n\n[music - en vogue, \"hold on\"]\n\nAnd the first song that comes on in this class is En Vogue\u2019s \u201cHold On, which, you know, like nice to hear the girls again. And then I think maybe the fourth song is J. Cole\u2019s \u201cNo Role Modelz.\u201d\n\njenna wortham\n\nOK.\n\narchived recording (adrian williams) We got one more.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd I\u2019m like \u2014\n\narchived recording (adrian williams) Yeah, it\u2019s burning.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 there was an n-word.\n\narchived recording (adrian williams) Come on.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThere was another n-word.\n\narchived recording (adrian williams) This is only our first circuit.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean, it\u2019s a J. Cole song. It\u2019s n-words everywhere. So \u2014\n\narchived recording (adrian williams) Get your feelings in order.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 what happens when I, as a Black person, am in an environment where I don\u2019t want to hear that word? It\u2019s not a Black person using it on me, it\u2019s a Black person saying it in a space where I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m one of the very few Black people in the room.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWhat do I do with that? Who do I tell? I just have so many questions about the other people who are taking this class \u2014 are they hearing the word? I just feel like, suddenly, J. Cole and Adrian and I are performing for whoever else is in this class, and I can\u2019t see them.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm. I mean, not to be all armchair psycho about it, but you know, it sounds like, in a way, Adrian feels like he can assert his Blackness in this predominantly white space. We can\u2019t ignore the fact that this is happening in the wake of everything that happened last year, and especially last summer.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMhm.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI think Black people in this country have been waiting for the opportunity to take up a lot more psychic space, and I think Black people in this country were like, I am tired of feeling like I can\u2019t talk about the treatment that I endure. We\u2019ve seen people dropping the veneer of whatever post-racial fantasy. No, I want to talk about my day-to-day lived experience, which excites me, actually.\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut you know, it sounds like Adrian is using whatever tools he has at hand to take up space.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. Adrian didn\u2019t say why he played this J. Cole song, why that song was on his playlist. But every time I hear the word, though, I\u2019m just thinking, like, god, this word, this word. Why this word? I don\u2019t want to be dealing with this right now. Why, why, why?\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou know, again, I cannot see who else is in the class, but what I\u2019m thinking as I\u2019m hearing this J. Cole song is like, is anybody else bothered by this? And if they are bothered by it, is it a Black person who is bothered by it in the same way that I am?\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, I am always in awe of its deployment by Black people, but then I get really annoyed, as well, because I never, ever, ever want to hear that word coming out of a white person\u2019s mouth, no matter what. And I also think that, among most Black people, that is settled. Like, we don\u2019t want to hear y\u2019all say it because it just feels so devastating. And I\u2019m of two minds about it. And I guess that sounds like a double standard, but it really isn\u2019t if you sit with it and think about it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, I think this is the exact right moment to talk about this word. And we should talk about the spectrum of usages, not just in my exercise class or in music, but every place this word has resurfaced.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd you know, look, this word is heavy. It brings up a lot, clearly, for both of us, and we assume for our listeners, as well. And so we don\u2019t want you to be like Wesley caught out in Adrian\u2019s class, so this is just a little bit of a heads-up that we will be employing the word in all its uses in this episode. And prepare the body, do some little squats, get some water, because we\u2019re going to do this. Let\u2019s see what happens. Wesley, I know you\u2019re down. I\u2019m down. So get the \u201cGreen Book,\u201d get your mask, get in the car, let\u2019s go.\n\n[theme music]\n\nI\u2019m Jenna Wortham.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI\u2019m Wesley Morris. We\u2019re two culture writers at The New York Times.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThis is Still Processing.\n\nwesley morris\n\nJenna.\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh, Wesley.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou and I have for years been talking about the n-word. We\u2019ve been talking about our relationship to it. We\u2019ve been talking about whether we need it, how I feel about it, whether you use it. Part of the reason that I\u2019ve been thinking about this word so much is that it\u2019s been in our workplace recently.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the reason it\u2019s been in our work life is because a colleague used it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nA ton has been written about this incident, and if you really want to know more, Google is your friend. You can just deep dive right on in. But just to give you a quick overview of what happened, a white colleague of ours was on a school trip with a bunch of high school kids and used the word in a sentence. You know \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nRight. He used it quoting the word. He was not using it in the sort of conventional racist way. But he used it. And it essentially became this flashpoint in a conversation about whether or not it was OK to use the word. And you know, is there ever a good time to use it?\n\njenna wortham\n\nWell, and to get a little more specific, the debate spins out from there, ultimately results in our colleague leaving his job and leaving the New York Times.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd you know, I think that the thing that really upset me was that this word was going to threaten to tear our newsroom apart. You could feel it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nFor sure.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd it\u2019s really heartbreaking to see that this old-ass word is still boiling people\u2019s blood, it is still costing people things, it\u2019s still hurting people. I mean, I just can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThat word, it\u2019s not something that you expect to deal with in your workplace. You just feel so exposed and so vulnerable. And like, it just turns you inside out, because you\u2019re kind of doing this mental inventory of dredging up all the times someone has said the word around you or to you, and then tried to tell you it wasn\u2019t a big deal or to get over yourself. Because that\u2019s what this word does, it lives beyond time. And it\u2019s not something that anyone should have to deal with when they just want to show up and do their job. And it ate up so much of my energy. I mean, I kept being like, I\u2019m fine, but then while this was happening, at the end of every workday, I was just completely depleted. I didn\u2019t even have enough energy to take a bath. And I finally had to just admit and to reconcile, like, this is taking a huge toll. There\u2019s this Toni Morrison quote that is just very grammable, and so I\u2019ve seen it a bunch, but I\u2019ll just paraphrase it. But it\u2019s essentially that the function of racism is to be a distraction. And you get so caught up in explaining yourself and explaining your reason for being \u2014 and essentially defending your existence \u2014 that everything else falls away. And Ms. Morrison is cautioning us, do not fall into the trap. She\u2019s right. I mean, it\u2019s the only thing that you and I were able to talk about. Like, we were spending more time on the phone digging into this incident than we were talking about our book projects, talking about this show, talking about our love lives, talking about what we were cooking for dinner. Like, all we were obsessed with and consumed with was this word. And it was so unfair.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. I think it\u2019s America\u2019s word. I think that white people have a stake in it as much as Black people do. And it\u2019s been very interesting to watch white people defend their ability to use it. And it just really strikes me as being about a kind of sense of ownership in a way that they might not even intend.\n\njenna wortham\n\nDeeply embedded in that ownership is the most incredible time capsule, or maybe it\u2019s a ticking time bomb. And I think it\u2019s scary because I\u2019m like, do you know what lineage you\u2019re invoking? Do you understand how that word has been wielded throughout time? And maybe you should revisit \u201cRoots\u201d and just reorient yourself in the power of this word and the way it really comes from a desire to limit and reduce and diminish and humiliate and really render a person into nothingness. And ask yourself, is that worth all this?\n\nwesley morris\n\nBut I mean, the fact of the matter is that you and I are talking about a thing that is, like, among Black people, settled, right? Like, I mean, it seems \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nYes.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 settled, like, because it\u2019s so baked into Black culture that it\u2019s not going anywhere. When I lived in San Francisco, when I was 23 and 24 and 25 years old, I get on Muni, and you know, there\u2019d be some Filipino kids or some Chicano kids just hanging out on the subway n-wording each other.\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd I\u2019m like \u2014 I would go up to them as a recent college graduate and be like, yo \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh my god.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 y\u2019all need to stop. This is not your word. You can\u2019t say that.\n\njenna wortham\n\nProfessor Morris \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\n\u2014 reporting for duty. I love it so much.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. But I will report back to you that it didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThey were like, get out of my face.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. And I think part of what I was thinking, or what I was trying to do, was preserve it. If I could just get it out of Chicano usage, then I could sort of get Black people to stop using it, too. But it was a folly. Again, I was 23, and I realized it just wasn\u2019t useful. Like, there\u2019s no point in doing this. In terms of where it\u2019s going in the culture and who is using it, it\u2019s settled. It\u2019s settled. And to the degree to which, like, I was trying to win something, I was going to lose. I was just going to lose. I just had to come up with my own relationship to that word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYes. It almost sounds like you\u2019re trying to contain something that is uncontainable. You\u2019re trying to put this tool back in its box, right?\n\nwesley morris\n\nI was trying to put a lid on a boiling pot that had boiled all \u2014 been boiling over for centuries. Yes. Yes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nWhy did that feel important to you?\n\nwesley morris\n\nWow, Jenna. Because it\u2019s such an ugly word. It\u2019s such a, like, horrible word to me, and I wasn\u2019t \u2014 like, hearing it come out of mouths that weren\u2019t even Black people, but they weren\u2019t white people, either. And they weren\u2019t using it maliciously, right? But it didn\u2019t matter because to my ear, hearing it come out of any non-Black mouth, it upset me. It hurt me that they didn\u2019t understand the degree to which that word is a toxic or radioactive element in any Black person\u2019s social life. It was as common for them to call each other the n-word as it was for Black people to use it on each other.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, when people are using that word in that really familial, familiar sense who are not Black, right, it\u2019s of course the co-option of Black culture and the proximity to Blackness. You get so many points by inhabiting Blackness, but not actually being Black yourself, right? Just look at the entire Kardashian empire. And I\u2019m really thinking about this pink Uno deck that came out this summer from one of the Jenners. Like, Uno, why? Why? It makes me angry to think about it. Like, you know why, right? Because they wanted to name that they know about Black things, including Uno. Let it go, OK? There are hundreds of card games that you could have chosen, and you chose that one for a very particular reason. As a related note, the artist Nina Chanel Abney put a a Uno deck \u2014 a very Black Uno deck \u2014 which is amazing. I bought 10 of them, just in defiance to the Jenner deck. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is, the closer you can get to Blackness and Black people without actually being Black, it places you in this really interesting cultural hierarchy because people love that. They love it. They love to see Blackness on non-Black people. It feels really edgy. It feels really cool. It feels like you\u2019re getting close to something without actually having to engage with the thing itself, also called anti-Blackness. But so I think there\u2019s that. I guess, you know, I\u2019m always in awe of the n-word. And as much as I don\u2019t want to hear it, when it is employed in this cultural sense \u2014 whether it\u2019s used as a greeting, whether it\u2019s used in a song, pretty much any time it\u2019s not being used by a white person, right \u2014 I really have to take a step back and, like, admire the power and the energy that it took to transform that word into something that can be used in that way. That word, which was erected to create a category of otherness, to create a category of non-humanness, to create a category of people who weren\u2019t even seen as people, but to create us and then y\u2019all. And we can do whatever we want to y\u2019all because you\u2019re not really people, you\u2019re this other word. And to really, over time, that that word could mutate into this other usage, I mean, that is like \u2014 think about the power that that takes. Think about how much energy you have to invest. It took years of polishing that word, right, to get it to where it needed to be. To change it enough that it could be used in a way, in a multitude of ways, that are vastly different from the original creation of that word.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah. Yeah, I think that a little bit of what I\u2019m trying to get at about the Muni situation was I think, in some ways, the fight for what it took to get to the place where Black people could even use it and have it be loving and affectionate and normalized, but at the same time, you know \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nYeah.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 I grew up in a family that didn\u2019t use it. And I think my grandmother, who was born in 1928, was one of those \u2014 we\u2019re basically Yankees. Nobody goes any further south than Maryland on my mother\u2019s side of the family. And \u2014\n\njenna wortham\n\nI love that.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 most of us are in Philadelphia. My family was really concerned with, as were many people in my grandmother\u2019s generation, with being upstanding and good even if you were poor and had nothing \u2014 which we were, and had lots of nothing. But there was this dichotomy that springs up, which is the difference between a Negro and an n-word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nOh, lord. Yes, many conversations were had about that when I was a child.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou know, my grandmother had a whole speech about n-words versus Black people. So much of their self-worth was in being defined against the n-word, and a lifetime \u2014 a childhood, childhoods, of being called that word by white people. And I mean, I don\u2019t know if you remember this, but Chris Rock has a very, very, very famous routine about this. In his classic \u201cBring the Pain\u201d routine, that I VHSed, by the way \u2014 I used to watch that over and over and over and over \u2014 he starts and says, I love Black people, but I hate n-words.\n\narchived recording (chris rock) Now, we\u2019ve got a lot of things, a lot of racism going on in the world right now. Who is more racist, Black people or white people? Black people. You know why? Because we hate Black people, too. Everything white people don\u2019t like about Black people, Black people really don\u2019t like about Black people.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the audience goes crazy because they know that he\u2019s about to go there.\n\narchived recording (chris rock) There\u2019s like a civil war going on with Black people. And there\u2019s two sides. There\u2019s Black people and there\u2019s [n-words]. And [n-words] have got to go. Every time Black people want to have a good time, ignorant-ass [n-words] [EXPLCIT] it up.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHe\u2019s using the word, and he is letting it sit in his mouth like a really delicious sip of red wine that is still oxidizing. Like, he\u2019s holding it in his mouth, just getting all the flavor out of it. Like, he\u2019s chewing it like a piece of meat.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI mean, he\u2019s also making it sound like the word that it is, right? He\u2019s making it sound like it is a vile, ugly, disgusting word. The disgust with which he says that word, every time he says it, it is palpable, and it is vicious and vivid.\n\narchived recording (chris rock) Can\u2019t go to a movie the first week it come out. Why? Because [n-words] are shooting at the screen. Hey, I love Black people, but I hate [n-words].\n\njenna wortham\n\nYeah, that bit is really working on so many levels. And there\u2019s of course just like the entry level, right, which is it\u2019s been a lecture that\u2019s been passed down to you from your parents, your grandparents. But it\u2019s also acknowledging the vestigial hatred and trauma that comes with the need \u2014 I\u2019m using air quotes \u2014 to make that distinction, right? And this kind of historical, repetitive task that Black people find themselves engaged in \u2014 that I still find myself engaged in \u2014 when you start doing kind of these mental gymnastics to physically, emotionally, psychically assert that you\u2019re not a bad Black person. You\u2019re not one of them, right? And it\u2019s something that comes up for me when I go into like a high-end store. I try to look like I have money. You know, it\u2019s something that comes up for me when I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019ve actually stopped doing this, to be honest with you, but like making sure my hands are out of my pockets or making sure that my purse isn\u2019t open. I mean, I don\u2019t carry purses \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh, I still \u2014 involuntary things I do when I go into public space so that nobody gets the wrong idea about me, same thing.\n\njenna wortham\n\nRight.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThere\u2019s a degree to which being Black is a lot about optics, and a lot about having white people, having white society \u2014 the American caste system, basically \u2014 take you seriously to seem or look or sound worthy of being in that upper tier of the caste system, right? Part of my visceral reaction as being a 23-year-old who had finally felt like he had made it in San Francisco was the hope and prayer that I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with that word. And the idea that I\u2019m just on a subway on the West Coast \u2014 a place I had never been before but had these utopian feelings about \u2014 and here I am on the subway, as though I had never even left Philadelphia, having to contend with this word being used by not even Black people or white people? It just was too much for me. And I think that, to the degree to which my personality has been formed without even realizing it, Jenna, in opposition to being an n-word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd it\u2019s tied to that bit because it comes from a place of having to fight for your worthiness, and it also comes from a direct historical experience of people who were called that word and their life hung in the balance, right? Like, someone is saying that word to you, you know that they\u2019re also willing to probably kill you, right? And so that\u2019s something your grandmother\u2019s tapping into, that\u2019s something my father is tapping into when they\u2019re telling us don\u2019t be an n-word. And it\u2019s really scary and it\u2019s really sad. And I think, you know, you and I are both reading the same book right now, which is by Randall Kennedy. It\u2019s called \u2014 the first word \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe actual word.\n\njenna wortham\n\n\u2014 it\u2019s called the actual word, colon, \u201cThe Strange Career of a Troublesome Word.\u201d And career is so interesting as a term because it is doing work. It is performing labor. And that labor is divisive. The labor is, as long as there\u2019s someone below me, I\u2019m OK. And again, that\u2019s like a very insidious example of, like, white supremacist thinking that continues to need a lowest common denominator to rise above. And so for me, that\u2019s the most interesting case to retire the word, even among Black people, because it does work. Like, it does a type of work that even when we can\u2019t directly see it sweating, it is working, honey. Like, it is working in the same way that it worked since it came into existence.\n\nwesley morris\n\nIt\u2019s also much different to say it than it is to write it, I have to say. To put it in a set of quotation marks in a piece that you are writing no matter who you are is just different to me than saying it out loud. I have to make a reservation with my soul a week in advance before I say the word. It\u2019s like, Wesley, don\u2019t forget, on March 15, 2021, you are going to say the whole word. This is the gymnastics that I put myself through, where like even the idea of saying it just results in me, like, almost having a stroke. You know, I\u2019ve been on this journey with this word, just really thinking about it in ways that I had never really seriously thought about it before, because I was so busy reacting against it. But I actually think that there is something \u2014 for as ugly as it is, I also think there\u2019s something so beautiful about it. And I think that, when you feel its power and you feel \u2014 when you see a Black person wield it, there\u2019s also just nothing, nothing like that. So let\u2019s just take a break. And when we come back, we\u2019re just going to talk about the beauty of the word. The impossible beauty of that word.\n\n[music]\n\njenna wortham\n\nI have to admit that I always feel a little silly saying, like, the n-word, as though that doesn\u2019t mean something else.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYes.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThe n-word, you know? Like, what does that even mean, you know?\n\nwesley morris\n\nJenna, you\u2019re reading my mind. Yeah.\n\njenna wortham\n\nIt\u2019s so like, OK, we\u2019re children. But listen, I grew up in a household where that word was not permitted to be used in any capacity. It was pretty well-ingrained in me, that\u2019s not a word we use. And because I\u2019m me, and pretty much everything someone tells me I can\u2019t do, I find a way to do \u2014\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh my god, this is where we\u2019re the opposite.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI\u2019m a boundary pusher. I love finding the limits of something and then trying to get past that. So when I got to college, I went to U.V.A., as you know, which is a predominantly white school, but jokingly inside we called it a knockoff H.B.C.U. because there were just so many Black people there. And I met this crew of girls. We became super tight. We\u2019re still close. And we loved to call each other the n-word. It felt really good to live in this space. It felt really good to be defiant. It felt really good to feel out something, at least for me, that had been taboo, and to play around with it and just employ it very liberally. And it felt like ours. It felt like something that belonged to us and only we could use, and we really leaned into it. And I felt really free. You know? It felt really fun. And it also felt like kinship. You know? It felt really special to have this term of endearment that always cracked us up. And I feel like we played around a lot with figuring out how to say it, because that one word with the A-A-H at the end of it has eons of inflections to it. It just contains entire galaxies of humor if you say it at the right time, in the right tone of voice, cutting it off at the exact right minute. I mean, in itself is such a tool of comedy. And it was fun to figure out how to perfect and play around with it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMhm.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut I\u2019ve gone through over the last couple of years and really worked through really working on removing gender-specific references, gendered pronouns, skimming my vocabulary and my assumptions about ableism. You know, making space for different experiences and really trying to be mindful. So I\u2019ve just arrived in a place, where I\u2019m at today, it just doesn\u2019t feel as good. And I think I\u2019m just really tuning in to a sensitivity and a frequency of, you know, we\u2019re tired. And a lot of us \u2014 and I\u2019m speaking right now about Black people \u2014 a lot of us are just really fragile. At some point in the last nine years, after Trayvon Martin, I mean, I was experiencing this myself, but I just became really attuned to a fragility among some Black people. And understanding how the word, even when used by Black people in \u2014 I\u2019ll just say a safe space, in community spaces \u2014 that it still dredged up that historical trauma, and that it still had this impact really shaped me. And it just naturally faded away. Like, it faded from my popular use. And it felt right. You know? That felt right. I don\u2019t want to \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want to hurt anybody. I don\u2019t want to inflict more harm upon a Black person if I can help it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, I mean, you know, this is a word that has been \u2014 any living Black person, it\u2019s been in your life probably the entire time you\u2019ve been living.\n\njenna wortham\n\nIt\u2019s probably been in your life even before you knew what the word meant.\n\nwesley morris\n\nOh, yeah.\n\njenna wortham\n\nLike, I remember my niece coming home from school and being like, what\u2019s jigger? Like, in preschool. It starts even before you have a sense of yourself as a racialized being. The world racializes you first. This is why we get so worked up about it, because it is just so much bigger than one instance, one mistake, one rap lyric. You know? It really enters your life even before you get a chance to figure out how you want to live your life. But the point I\u2019m trying to make is, when I was younger, I felt like that word was the only thing that, without a doubt, belonged to me as a Black person that did not belong to a white person. And if you really think about it, that\u2019s sad. But that\u2019s not my inheritance. That\u2019s not the thing that goes into the dowry, right? That\u2019s not in my trunk of keepsakes that I\u2019ll take with me when I move into my married house like in the old days. You know? It\u2019s just not an antique for me. You know? It wasn\u2019t mine to begin with. I\u2019m in awe of it, but it\u2019s not in my shoebox.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMm. You know, I was thinking about how aware of it I was as a kid. You know, my dad was a big comedy records person. He listened to all his favorite comedians. And one of his favorite people to listen to, Richard Pryor.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHm. Mhm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd Richard Pryor is the greatest practitioner of the n-word in the history of its usage.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHm.\n\nwesley morris\n\nNobody has done more to simultaneously problematize that word, but also to normalize it as a way of being in the world.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou know, it\u2019s so funny because you sent me the album, and I didn\u2019t listen to it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI sent you a copy of \u201cThat N-word Is Crazy.\u201d\n\njenna wortham\n\nMhm. So when I think of Richard Pryor, I think about my dad. I think about Joe Wortham because he loved that type of comedy. Even though we were not allowed to use the n-word, even though we were not \u2014 oh my god, we had so many rules, and I think this is very much from my dad\u2019s trauma of growing up in the South, and then even being in Philadelphia, you know, I think he had a lot of trauma around us getting fingered as n-words with the hard \u201d-er.\u201d So there were a lot of rules about what we could and couldn\u2019t say, how we were supposed to speak, how we were supposed to wear our hair. When I was younger, it felt so controlling and restrictive \u2014 and it was. And I also, now that I\u2019ve aged, I understand that he was trying to protect us from something that he had not been able to protect himself from. And he wasn\u2019t able to protect us from it, either, to be honest, but that really weighs on my mind. So it was this confusing thing for me. So I would be a little kid. You know, picture me eight, nine, 10 years old on my belly, coloring in a book. And Richard Pryor is on the TV, you know, saying this word. And I\u2019m just like (GASPING) in that little kid way, where you\u2019re like, that\u2019s a bad word. So for me, Richard Pryor just always had this association of taboo. And even as an adult, I still haven\u2019t fully listened to that record. And you sent it to me. You sent me a copy, and I couldn\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t do it. I felt scared to open that chest.\n\nwesley morris\n\nMhm. That\u2019s fascinating. Yeah, I mean, he is doing the work of reclaiming the word, in a way. I mean, you know, at that point, it is long part of African-American vernacular, but there\u2019s something about the way that he\u2019s doing it where, like, none of the other Black comedians were using that word. Dick Gregory didn\u2019t use it. Moms Mabley didn\u2019t use it. Flip Wilson didn\u2019t use it. Bill Cosby didn\u2019t use it. It was Richard Pryor.\n\narchived recording (richard pryor) White folks do things a lot different than [n-words] do. They eat quiet and shit you build out of it. archived recording 1 Pass the potatoes. [LAUGHTER] archived recording 2 Thank you, darling. Could I have a bit of that sauce?\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd the thing that really moved me was the way that it just wants that word to be another word for person \u2014 for Black person \u2014 and to unload it of all its negative connotations. It\u2019s so far away from Chris Rock\u2019s usage. There aren\u2019t Black people and n-words. There are just n-words. Every Black person is an n-word.\n\narchived recording (richard pryor) A lot of [n-words] ain\u2019t scared, you know what I mean? Like when the Martians landed and shit, white folks got scared. Oh, my. Golly! I\u2019ll tell ya! Just a big ol\u2019 helicopter thing came down and landed. People got on [INAUDIBLE] all over their body! Big ol\u2019 claw hands and shit! Jesus Christ! Nothing can scare a [n-word] after 400 years of this shit.\n\nwesley morris\n\nIt\u2019s still the most shocking word in the English language. It now just exists in two polar states. On the one hand, with Richard Pryor, there are white people. And on the other hand, there are n-words.\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] Well, there are polls, and then there are hand grenades, like the one Rihanna threw on February 1 in response to a tweet hosted by Daniel Cameron.\n\nwesley morris\n\nDaniel Cameron, of course, being the attorney general of Kentucky, the man who presented the case to the grand jury as to whether or not to indict the police officers involved in Breonna Taylor\u2019s death.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd in case you didn\u2019t feel the giant wave of grief and sadness in September that rocked many people\u2019s worlds, none of them were indicted for her death. That decision unleashed such a wave of depression and disgust and anger and angst that, once again, another unarmed Black person dies at the hand of the police and no one is willing to do anything. So there\u2019s just a lot around this man who was Black. So five months later, this man dust off his microphone and tweets, \u201cToday marks the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth.\u201d And then Twitter auto-populates with the little trifecta of the three Black raised fist. Then it continues. \u201cThis month, let\u2019s take time to remember and celebrate the contributions Black men and women have made to our Commonwealth and our nation.\u201d So he tweets that. And here comes Rihanna. She retreats him and adds the line, \u201cSup, n-word. #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor.\u201d Microphone drop.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah, well, we should talk about what she\u2019s making that word do.\n\njenna wortham\n\nWell, it\u2019s very interesting to notice that she employed the heated spayd games version with the \u201ca\u201d and not the historic plantation version with the \u201cer.\u201d That\u2019s the first thing to notice.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe other thing is that \u2014 this is a Black on Black operation here. It\u2019s happening on Twitter in a very public place. But it also is like an interesting call in, because it\u2019s simultaneously about this Black person not doing right by Black people \u2014 according to, in this instance, Rihanna and the many people who agree with her that justice was not served for Breonna Taylor. But it also \u2014 she\u2019s using the word in the ugliest possible way that you can use it on a Black person, which is to say that you are an instrument of white power.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYou\u2019re perpetuating harm against Black people. And you aren\u2019t doing all that you can to live up to the best of what Black History Month purports to be about. And she is saying that whatever you just tweeted is hypocrisy. And all of those things are there in that one word.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd she\u2019s also letting him know, like \u2014 I mean, this is the part that\u2019s hard to really grapple with, but he can always just be an n-word.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThat\u2019s the other usage, right? That\u2019s the other thing that this tweet is connected to for me. And so you have these two contexts for this word converging in these two words. And it\u2019s just \u2014 I hope nobody ever sends me a tweet like that.\n\njenna wortham\n\nI was just thinking that. But I also think that her ability to use it \u2014 it is such a linguistic power move. Especially an artist, right? Someone who\u2019s thinking with so much deliberation about lyrics and words and presentation. Like, of course Rihanna understands, with just so much clarity and awareness, the chimeric quality of language and especially that word.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, I mean, you saying that makes me want to ask you if we can go back to Adrian Williams for a second.\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] OK.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWhy is what she did to Daniel Cameron OK to my visceral self? And I have a real problem being in that space with Adrian Williams and these white people that I can\u2019t see with the J. Cole song. And the place that it takes me is this song by Solange, and I know very well, called \u201cFUBU.\u201d Writ large, the song is basically about Black culture belonging to Black people. And the opening lyrics of the song are all my n-words in the whole wide world.\n\n[music - solange, \"fubu\"]\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) All my [n-words] in the whole wide world.\n\nwesley morris\n\nAnd it\u2019s just so clear that she\u2019s drawing a line around a kind of space, around a kind of cultural space.\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) Make this song to make it all y\u2019all\u2019s turn for us. This shit is for us.\n\njenna wortham\n\nWell, as improbable as it sounds, I\u2019m not sure that the deployment is all that different between Adrian and Solange, truth be told. You know, Solange makes this album in 2017. And the name of the album is \u201cA Seat at the Table.\u201d And she does an interview and she\u2019s describing her word choice in that song. And she acknowledges, I don\u2019t normally use the n-word in my songs. But at the time, I was on a road trip through Marfa, of all places. Marfa, Texas \u2014 really gorgeous artsy town in West Texas. Sky for days. A lot of creatives go there to make work. A lot of Black artists go there to make work. Solange is like, we\u2019re visiting friends. We\u2019ve been here a million times. And we have this really scary encounter with the police, right? They get hassled. And she\u2019s also reading \u201cCitizen: An American Lyric\u201d by Claudia Rankine who\u2019s a poet and devotes an entire text to her relationship to racism and racial aggressions and microaggressions and the depressed state it leaves her in. And Solange is just like, you know what? I\u2019m not going to tiptoe around it. I\u2019m going to say what I want. I\u2019m going to lean into my artistic intuition, which is telling me to make a song, and to make this song. And there are just some things that are for us. And you know, in that song, she\u2019s not just talking about the n-word. She\u2019s talking about cornrows, she\u2019s talking about affectations of speech. She\u2019s just talking about so many things. You can put these things on all you want. You can layer on all these accouterments of blackness. But you will never be Black. Some things are for us.\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) All my [n-words] in the whole wide world.\n\njenna wortham\n\nHearing her do that song live really does something in the body. It does something to you. It does create a space. And even if you\u2019re in mixed company, even if there are non-Black people there, it still gives you that endorphin high that you always get in a musical setting when you\u2019re in a live music setting. But you really feel loved and cared for and a sense of ownership. And it\u2019s also like a caution, it\u2019s like a yellow yield sign too where she\u2019s also saying, back up, because if you are a white person in that space, and you\u2019re watching people really just have a full body transformative experience, I think you understand something too, right? And it became this anthem of pride and ownership. And then when her next album comes out, \u201cWhen I Get Home,\u201d she releases a song called \u201cAlmeda\u201d which has the same message, the same energy, and does not use the n-word.\n\n[music - solange, \"almeda\"]\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) We just sittin\u2019 here fooling around. We just sittin\u2019 here coolin\u2019 around. We just sittin\u2019 here high, comin\u2019 down.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAnd she\u2019s just going through all these things she loves about being Black. And it has the exact same effect in some ways. It\u2019s just a different approach into it. I mean, just like, what kind of white person is going to sing along to all the n-words in \u201cFUBU\u201c? I mean, it\u2019s also really hard, I think, to be a white person or a non-Black person and sing along to the lyrics in \u201cAlmeda\u201d which \u2014 brown skin, brown face, brown leather, brown sugar, brown \u2014 I mean, you know \u2014 black waves, black days, black baes, black things.\n\narchived recording (solange) (SINGING) \u2014 brown zippers, brown face, black skin, black braids, black waves, black days, black baes, black days.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThese are Black-owned things. That\u2019s also precious. And that\u2019s also something that is creating this protective sphere around everyone that\u2019s listening to it and singing along to it. You know, I think it was really important for her as an artist to say, I\u2019m fed up. And this is what that looks like. And then to kind of keep that thread going and do it in a totally different way because \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like, I think, Adrian, his own way \u2014 he was fed up. And he was tired of feeling like he had to tiptoe around something.\n\nwesley morris\n\nYeah, yeah. I mean he \u2014 it\u2019s interesting though, because it\u2019s so subtle, right? You know, that reclamation of space, because it doesn\u2019t make it any easier to hear that word in that space, because I guess I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m sharing that space with. And I think that does matter still to me. And he and I might even disagree about whether it\u2019s even worth playing that song. But I definitely respect his right to do it. I feel like that for me is a journey that I\u2019ve been on since I\u2019ve been talking to you. [LAUGHTER]\n\njenna wortham\n\nWe\u2019re definitely on it together. We\u2019re on it together.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThere\u2019s a story that you and I have with this word. And the reason \u2014 I want to tell you something about how it made me feel when you used it on me.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAre you really going to talk about that?\n\nwesley morris\n\nI do. I want to talk about it. Jenna, come on.\n\njenna wortham\n\nAll right, fine.\n\nwesley morris\n\nCome with me on this. Do you remember how you used it on me?\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] Yes, because it was purely without thinking. We were working together. You had done something ridiculous. And it just slipped. I was like, listen, like what are \u2014 no, what are you doing? And you were like \u2014 your face dropped. And I immediately apologized. I was like, I\u2019m so sorry. I realized we are different, of different ilks. I am so sorry. I did. I felt really bad. I still feel really bad.\n\nwesley morris\n\nI remember absorbing it.\n\njenna wortham\n\nYou did your Wesley thing when you\u2019re uncomfortable, which is you just busted out into a very inexplicable long laugh that had no end for many seconds. You just kept laughing.\n\nwesley morris\n\nWell, for the next three or four days after that, I was like, Jenna called me the n-word. Jenna called me the n-word. But it made me feel loved, I have to say.\n\njenna wortham\n\n[LAUGHS] This is crazy! This is bananas.\n\nwesley morris\n\n\u2014 It\u2019s really crazy. [LAUGHS] It\u2019s true, though.\n\njenna wortham\n\nThis word is bananas.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe word is bananas. But I only received it as \u2014 I mean, I was shocked that you said it. But I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. And I was like, I don\u2019t know. When Black people, in the rare occasions when it happens to me, when a person feels like they can do it, [SIGHS] I do feel like it\u2019s the Richard Pryor usage. It\u2019s love. And I carry that around with me, too.\n\njenna wortham\n\nBut that\u2019s \u2014 I am wondering why, that if you\u2019ve experienced that were as a vector of love and affection, what stops you from using it in the same way?\n\nwesley morris\n\n[SIGHS] [LAUGHS]\n\njenna wortham\n\nThere is that uncomfortable laughter again. I love it.\n\nwesley morris\n\nThe truth, the honest to God truth \u2014 the first thing that comes to my mind as an answer is I\u2019m just not that kind of Black person. I didn\u2019t grow up using it. And I get a lot of pleasure from other people\u2019s use of it so that I don\u2019t have to use it. You know, I mean \u2014 I mean, for me, it would require becoming a kind of different person in my imagining of what it would be like to use that word. I mean, maybe there\u2019ll be some point at which I\u2019m comfortable partaking in that. But I don\u2019t feel I have that in me. Does that make sense?\n\njenna wortham\n\nDefinitely.\n\n[theme music]\n\nwesley morris\n\nThat\u2019s our show. And the good news is that we\u2019re sticking around for a whole season.

Administering the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine in London on Wednesday. Credit... Dan Kitwood/Getty Images AstraZeneca reiterated on Wednesday that its Covid-19 vaccine was very effective at preventing the disease, based on more recent data than was included when the company announced the interim results of its U.S. clinical trial on Monday. The company said in a news release that its vaccine was 76 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. That is slightly lower than the number that the company announced earlier this week. The new results strengthen the scientific case for the embattled vaccine. But they may not repair the damage to AstraZeneca\u2019s credibility after U.S. health officials and independent monitors issued an extraordinary rebuke of the company for not counting some Covid-19 cases when it announced its initial findings this week. In a news release on Wednesday, the company said complete results from its 32,000-person study showed that its vaccine was 76 percent effective. On Monday, the company had said the vaccine appeared to be 79 percent effective, based on an interim look at 141 Covid-19 cases that had turned up among volunteers before Feb. 17. The latest finding was based on 190 trial participants who had gotten sick with Covid-19. AstraZeneca said on Wednesday that the vaccine was 100 percent effective in preventing severe disease and 85 percent effective in preventing Covid-19 in people over age 65. When it unveiled its interim results on Monday, AstraZeneca ignored dozens of recently confirmed Covid-19 cases that had cropped up in trial volunteers before mid-February. Listen to \u2018The Daily\u2019: The State of Vaccinations A look at the rapid expansion of shots, the people who are still holding out, and the rules of the road for those who are inoculated. In a letter to the company and federal officials, the independent monitoring board that was helping oversee the clinical trial issued an unusual reprimand of AstraZeneca for appearing to cherry-pick data to make its vaccine appear more effective. \u201cDecisions like this are what erode public trust in the scientific process,\u201d the letter said. The members of the monitoring board wrote that their statistical modeling had found that the vaccine might have a lower efficacy rate \u2014 between 69 and 74 percent \u2014 if the Covid-19 cases in question were included in the analysis. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases later disclosed the panel\u2019s concerns via a public statement. It was not clear why the monitoring board\u2019s projection turned out to be lower than the figure in AstraZeneca\u2019s complete results. The latest results could still change because there are still 14 possible Covid-19 cases that AstraZeneca representatives have not yet classified as actual cases. Until they received the monitoring board\u2019s letter, AstraZeneca executives weren\u2019t aware that the panel expected them to include those cases in the results disclosed in their news release, according to a person familiar with the executives\u2019 thinking. Vaccine experts said the brushback from federal officials appeared to reflect high levels of distrust between American regulators and AstraZeneca. Some worried that the episode could damage public confidence not only in AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine, but in all coronavirus vaccines. \u201cThere seems to be a breakdown in relations between the D.S.M.B. and the company, which is probably due to a variety of factors and is sad,\u201d said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, referring to the independent monitoring board. \u201cThis vaccine is so important for global health and the disputes do not promote global health.\u201d The dust-up over AstraZeneca\u2019s U.S. trial results followed a safety scare in Europe that prompted more than a dozen countries to temporarily suspend use of the vaccine. Regulators in Europe said last week that a review had found the shot to be safe after a small number of people who had recently been inoculated developed blood clots and abnormal bleeding. The U.S. trial did not turn up any signs of such safety problems. Rebecca Robbins and\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhy is Europe having so much trouble vaccinating people? Shortages are just part of the problem. Registering for a vaccination in Milan this week. Credit... Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times The European Union, where coronavirus vaccinations are moving at a maddeningly slow pace compared with those in United States and Britain, made clear this week that it is willing to flex its muscles to get more doses for its citizens, going so far as to curb exports of vaccine from the bloc. But the E.U.\u2019s trouble inoculating its population does not result from an inadequate vaccine supply alone. Bureaucratic inertia, strategic errors, a diffusion of responsibility and logistical problems in booking appointments have all helped seriously undercut vaccination efforts. Consider the northern Italian town of Cremona, an early victim during the pandemic\u2019s initial explosion in Europe. Over the weekend, the mayor got a call that the local vaccination center was empty. The region\u2019s booking system had failed to contact and set up appointments with older residents \u2014 and more than 500 doses of vaccine were at risk of going to waste. \u201cThere was staff, there were also vaccines, but there were no people,\u201d said the mayor, Gianluca Galimberti. Similar scenarios are playing out throughout the country, as the authorities struggle to get vaccines to older and vulnerable Italians who most need them. But the problems getting people vaccinated are hardly limited to Italy. The temporary suspension last week by multiple countries of the AstraZeneca vaccine, one that the European Union has bet on, was just one indication of how Europe\u2019s rollouts have been plagued by an overabundance of caution, bad deals and flouted obligations by pharmaceutical companies. The situation remains so dire that the bloc unveiled emergency restrictions to curb exports of Covid-19 vaccines for six weeks. And the Italian government, acting on a request from the European Commission, the E.U. executive arm, sent the police to inspect 29 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in a facility outside Rome, amid suspicions of possible exports out of the bloc. Italy is paying an especially heavy price for the vaccination campaign problems. A full year after the country became the first Western nation to confront the virus, it now has the dubious distinction of having the highest rate of daily deaths from Covid-19 among Europe\u2019s major powers. And the missteps have especially affected Italy\u2019s most vulnerable population: the elderly. Fewer than one in five people over 80 have received both doses of a vaccine, and less than 5 percent of septuagenarians have received their first shot. When it comes to distributing vaccines, Italy is on par with France and Germany and a little behind Spain, but its difficulties in vaccinating older citizens are far more consequential, given that it is the country with the oldest population in Europe. \u201cEvery time the phone rings, I hope it\u2019s them,\u201d said Ester Bucco, a 84-year-old resident of the Lombardy region, who registered two months ago to get vaccinated.

Pool photo by Philip Fong FUKUSHIMA, Japan \u2014 When Bruna Noguchi signed up to be a torchbearer for the Tokyo Olympics a year and a half ago, she never dreamed it could be a controversial decision. But as the relay kicked off on Thursday morning in Fukushima Prefecture, the ceremony and those participating in it were at the center of a national debate, with many questioning whether the Games should go on in spite of the virus, the ballooning costs and other growing challenges. While more than three dozen people, including about 20 celebrities, have withdrawn from the relay, Ms. Noguchi, 22, has decided to participate. She is one of 10,000 people who will carry the torch over the next four months, from Fukushima to Okinawa in the far south to Hokkaido in the north and on to the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. \u201cI can understand the feelings of the people who have decided to withdraw from the relay,\u201d Ms. Noguchi said in a recent interview. \u201cBut I\u2019m not worried.\u201d The Japanese authorities had envisioned the start of the torch relay as a triumphant moment, and their choice of Fukushima as the launching point was heavily symbolic. Japan is calling these Games the \u201cRecovery Olympics,\u201d highlighting the country\u2019s recovery from the 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster that ravaged Fukushima and other parts of northeastern Japan, as well as the world\u2019s recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Seiko Hashimoto, president of the Tokyo organizing committee, said that it was \u201cvery meaningful\u201d that the relay would start in Fukushima and that she wished for \u201cthe entire world to take a look at the reconstruction done in East Japan.\u201d But the celebration on Thursday was subdued, and the relay was being carried out under a number of restrictions. Traditional Japanese drummers and a hula dance group opened the ceremony, performing before a group of around 150 attendees, who sat at socially distanced intervals and applauded politely. The ceremony and the first section of the relay were closed to the public. Routes will not be announced until 30 minutes before the start time, and spectators can attend the relay only in their home prefectures. No cheering or shouting is allowed, and fans must offer \u201csupport with applause or using distributed goods.\u201d The relay will be live-streamed by NHK, Japan\u2019s public broadcaster. Despite the precautions, some people in Fukushima said they were still worried. Shuhei Ohno, 34, a chef in Koriyama, said he feared that the torch relay might \u201craise the infection risk\u201d nationwide. \u201cThe vaccine hasn\u2019t spread widely enough in Japan yet, so how can there already be plans to host the Olympics?\u201d he said. Still, the organizers are pressing ahead. Over the next 121 days, Ms. Noguchi and her fellow torchbearers will trot across Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures, including islands off the coast of Tokyo, before completing the torch\u2019s journey on July 23, the day of the opening ceremony.

Sebastian Hidalgo for The New York Times United Airlines plans to add more than two dozen new flights starting Memorial Day weekend, the latest sign that demand for leisure travel is picking up as the national vaccination rate moves higher. Most of the new flights will connect cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations, such as Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina; Portland, Maine; Savannah, Ga.; and Pensacola, Fla. United also said it planned to offer more flights to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America and South America in May than it did during the same month in 2019. The airline has seen ticket sales rise in recent weeks, according to Ankit Gupta, United\u2019s vice president of domestic network planning and scheduling. Customers are booking tickets further out, too, he said, suggesting growing confidence in travel. \u201cOver the past 12 months, this is the first time we are really feeling more bullish,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. Airports have been consistently busier in recent weeks than at any point since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a standstill a year ago. Well over one million people were screened at airport security checkpoints each day over the past two weeks, according to the Transportation Security Administration, although the number of screenings is down more than 40 percent compared with the same period in 2019. Most of the new United flights will be offered between Memorial Day weekend and Labor Day weekend aboard the airline\u2019s regional jets, which have 50 seats. The airline said it would also add new flights between Houston and Kalispell, Mont.; Washington and Bozeman, Mont.; Chicago and Nantucket, Mass.; and Orange County, Calif., and Honolulu. All told, United said it planned to operate about 58 percent as many domestic flights this May as it did in May 2019 and 46 percent as many international flights. Most of the demand for international travel has been focused on warm beach destinations that have less-stringent travel restrictions. \u201cThat is one of the strongest demand regions in the world right now,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cA lot of the leisure traffic has sort of shifted to those places and it\u2019s actually seen a boom in bookings.\u201d Delta Air Lines issued a similar update last week, announcing more than 20 nonstop summer flights to mountain, beach and vacation destinations. Both airlines have said in recent weeks that they have made substantial progress toward reducing how much money they are losing every day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBoris Johnson hopes Britain\u2019s vaccine success will vindicate his Brexit project.

Now, Mr. Johnson\u2019s allies hope the stark disparity between Britain\u2019s performance and the European Union\u2019s will do something perhaps even more challenging: vindicate their larger Brexit project. Pro-Brexit politicians and commentators are casting Britain\u2019s vaccine deployment, which ranks among the fastest in the world, as an example of risk-taking and entrepreneurial pluck that comes from not being shackled to the collective decision-making of the 27 member states of the European Union. With vaccination rates that are a fraction of Britain\u2019s, threats of export bans on vaccines produced on the continent and churlish statements about British-made vaccines by leaders like President Emmanuel Macron of France, the European Union has seemingly done all it can to make it look like Britain picked the right time to leave. \u201cBoris Johnson is going to have a vaccine dividend, and that will give him a whole new narrative for the summer and beyond,\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent. It\u2019s a narrative that seeks to deflect attention from the costs of Brexit since Britain severed itself from the European Union in January \u2014 damaging disruptions to cross-channel trade and businesses choking on reams of red tape, among other headaches. And it conveniently ignores the harrowing experience many Britons had with the virus before the first vaccine \u201cjabs\u201d arrived last December. Until then, Mr. Johnson\u2019s government was known mainly for its dilatory and erratic response to the pandemic \u2014 tardy lockdowns, frequent policy reversals, muddled public messaging and a hapless test-and-trace system \u2014 all of which contributed to Britain having the highest death toll in Europe. Now, though, the prime minister\u2019s approval ratings have recovered, powered largely by the public\u2019s enthusiasm about the vaccine rollout. In a new survey, 67 percent of respondents said they thought Britain had performed better on vaccinations than E.U. countries. A slight plurality \u2014 40 percent \u2014 said they thought Brexit had helped improve Britain\u2019s handling of the pandemic, while 14 percent said it had made it worse, and 38 percent thought it had made no difference. Mr. Johnson\u2019s vaccine bounce, analysts point out, could be fleeting if a new variant emerges or if the economy does not recover swiftly. But Mr. Goodwin said one consequence of the vaccine success is that there are few signs of significant numbers of people rethinking the wisdom of Brexit or suffering the acute regret \u2014 or as he called it, \u201cBregret\u201d \u2014 that some expected.

Rory Doyle for The New York Times When Bobby Wayne, 64, called a Mississippi state hotline this week to find out where he could get the Covid-19 vaccine, he says, an operator gave him incorrect \u2014 and unnerving \u2014 information. \u201cThis is the way she put it to me: They had no documentation that the vaccine was effective,\u201d Mr. Wayne recalled. \u201cAnd then she asked me did I still want to take it.\u201d When he replied yes, the operator told him that there were no appointments available and that he should call again the next morning, he said. The Mississippi State Department of Health chalked the misinformation up to confusion, saying it was the result of \u201cmiscommunication\u201d over a misleading script given to the hotline operators. The script was referring to pregnant women, women who are lactating and people with compromised immune systems. It asked: \u201cDo you still want to be vaccinated with an understanding there are currently no available data on the safety or effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines, including Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, in pregnant people, lactating people or immunocompromised people?\u201d Most experts agree that the risks to pregnant women from Covid-19 are far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines. Doctors have also said they believe that the vaccines are safe for people with autoimmune conditions. Liz Sharlot, a spokeswoman for the state health department, said that the wording in the script could be confusing \u201cwhen read out of context.\u201d \u201cWe are replacing this confusing and misleading language,\u201d she said in a statement. However, Ms. Sharlot said the operators had never been told that there was no documented proof that the Moderna vaccine or any other vaccine authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration worked. \u201cJust the opposite is true,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth Moderna and Pfizer have high efficacy rates.\u201d Mr. Wayne\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth Wayne, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, complained on Twitter about her father\u2019s conversation with the hotline operator, equating it with \u201cviolence.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous,\u201d Dr. Wayne said in an interview. \u201cThere is a therapy available. There is a way to treat something, and you\u2019re making it difficult for them to have access to that treatment so it\u2019s increasing the likelihood they may become sick.\u201d The Mississippi Free Press reported the story after Dr. Wayne posted about her father\u2019s experience on Twitter. Dr. Wayne said she was pleased that the health department appeared to take her concerns, and her father\u2019s, seriously. \u201cI think it was a really good example of the State Health Department trying to reach out because they actually want to restore faith\u201d in the vaccine, she said.

The Atlantic provinces, however, continued to require anyone entering from the rest of Canada to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nAs with the first round of the pandemic, long term care homes have been hard hit in many provinces by the return of the virus. British Columbia also saw its once enviable record for controlling the virus evaporate.\n\nFor most of the year, the pandemic generally had not been a partisan issue nor did it feature that rancor that usually characterizes relations between provinces and the federal government.

It was the first time the entire border had been shut since Canada became a nation in 1867.

There are no monetary penalties for such violations, though workers can be made whole through back pay.\n\nThe PRO Act would outlaw mandatory anti-union meetings, enact financial penalties for threatening or firing workers and help wrongly terminated workers win quick reinstatement.

All told, United said it planned to operate about 58 percent as many domestic flights this May as it did in May 2019 and 46 percent as many international flights. Most of the demand for international travel has been focused on warm beach destinations that have less-stringent travel restrictions. \u201cThat is one of the strongest demand regions in the world right now,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cA lot of the leisure traffic has sort of shifted to those places and it\u2019s actually seen a boom in bookings.\u201d Delta Air Lines issued a similar update last week, announcing more than 20 nonstop summer flights to mountain, beach and vacation destinations. Both airlines have said in recent weeks that they have made substantial progress toward reducing how much money they are losing every day.\n\nUnemployment claims will indicate the recovery\u2019s traction.

Michael Young for The New York Times The labor market\u2019s ability to improve as the economy recovers and the virus recedes will be tested Thursday morning when the government reports the latest data on unemployment claims. Although the pace of vaccinations, as well as passage of a $1.9 trillion relief package this month, has lifted economists\u2019 expectations for growth, the labor market has lagged behind other measures of recovery. At 6.2 percent, the unemployment rate is still nearly three percentage points above where it was in February 2020, before the coronavirus arrived in force. Initial claims, counting regular unemployment insurance and emergency programs, have been at more than one million a week since the fall, partly because some workers have been laid off more than once. Still, the easing of restrictions on indoor dining areas, health clubs, movie theaters and other gathering places offers hope for the millions of workers who were let go in the last 12 months. And the $1,400 checks going to most Americans as part of the relief bill should help spending perk up in the weeks ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting to see sharp declines in jobless claims in the coming weeks as the service sector comes back online,\u201d said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. \u201cThe labor market will benefit from a reopening, but it will take time for a complete recovery.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not out of this yet,\u2019 Esther George of the Fed says.

Ann Saphir/Reuters Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, says that although the outlook for growth has improved as vaccinations increase and the government rolls out relief packages, the path of the pandemic remains a major question hanging over the U.S. and global economies. \u201cWe\u2019re not out of this yet,\u201d Ms. George said in an interview on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what the dynamics will be on the other side.\u201d Ms. George said she was focused on labor force participation as a sign of the job market\u2019s strength more than the headline unemployment rate, which has fallen to 6.2 percent from a 14.8 percent peak but misses many people who aren\u2019t looking for new jobs after losing theirs during the pandemic. Participation, the share of people working or looking, remains a hefty two percentage points below its prepandemic levels. \u201cThat might be the thing I really watch in the coming months,\u201d she said. Ms. George expects inflation to \u201cfirm,\u201d but that the process is likely to take a while, she said, and it is \u201ctoo soon to say\u201d whether it will end with a more meaningful rise. Some prominent economists have begun to warn that prices, which have been low for decades, could rise rapidly as the government spends big and the Fed keeps rates at rock bottom to support the economic recovery. \u201cWages are a very telling factor in a story about inflation,\u201d Ms. George said. Many economists look for faster growth in compensation as a signal that inflation is sustainable, not just driven by short-lived supply constraints or temporary quirks in the data. Ms. George\u2019s colleagues, including Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, have been clear that they expect prices to move higher this year but will not necessarily see that as an achievement of their inflation goal. The Fed redefined its target last year and now aims for 2 percent annual price gains, on average, over time. Ms. George did not venture a guess of when the Fed will hit its three criteria for raising interest rates: full employment, 2 percent realized price gains and the expectation of higher inflation for some time. Some Fed officials expect to raise rates next year or in 2023, but most of them expect the initial increase to come even later.

Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Companies harmed by the coronavirus pandemic can soon borrow up to $500,000 through the Small Business Administration\u2019s emergency lending program, raising a cap that has frustrated many applicants. \u201cThe pandemic has lasted longer than expected,\u201d Isabella Casillas Guzman, the agency\u2019s administrator, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe are here to help our small businesses, and that is why I\u2019m proud to more than triple the amount of funding they can access.\u201d The change to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program \u2014 known as EIDL and pronounced as idle \u2014 will take effect the week of April 6. Those who have already received loans but might now qualify for more money will be contacted and offered the opportunity to apply for an increase, the agency said. The Small Business Administration has approved $200 billion in disaster loans to 3.8 million borrowers since the program began last year. Unlike the forgivable loans made through the larger and more prominent Paycheck Protection Program, the disaster loans must be paid back. But they carry a low interest rate and a long repayment term. Normally, the decades-old disaster program makes loans of up to $2 million, and in the early days of the pandemic, the agency gave some applicants as much as $900,000. But it soon capped loans at $150,000 because it feared exhausting the available funding. That limit \u2014 which the agency did not tell borrowers about for months \u2014 angered applicants who needed more capital to keep their struggling ventures alive. The agency has $270 billion left to lend through the pandemic relief program, James Rivera, the head of the agency\u2019s Office of Disaster Assistance, told senators at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nTired of Zoom calls? So is Citigroup\u2019s chief executive. Jane Fraser in 2019. \u201cThe blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\u201d she told Citigroup employees. Credit... Erin Scott/Reuters Complaints of \u201cZoom fatigue\u201d have emerged across industries and classrooms in the past year, as people confined to working from home faced schedules packed with virtual meetings and often followed up by long video catch-ups with friends, reports Anna Schaverien of The New York Times. But Citigroup, one of the world\u2019s largest banks, is trying to start a new end-of-week tradition meant to combat that fatigue: Zoom-free Fridays. The bank\u2019s new chief executive, Jane Fraser, announced the plan for in a memo sent to employees on Monday. Recognizing that workers have spent inordinate amounts of the past 12 months staring at video calls, Citi is encouraging its employees to take a step back from Zoom and other videoconferencing platforms for one day a week, she said. \u201cThe blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\u201d Ms. Fraser wrote in the memo, which was seen by The New York Times. No one at the company would have to turn their video on for any internal meetings on Fridays, she said. External meetings would not be affected. The bank outlined other steps to restore some semblance of work-life balance. It recommended employees stop scheduling calls outside of traditional working hours and pledged that when employees can return to offices, a majority of its workers would be given the option to work from home up to two days a week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story"}]
